<headline>Row on devolution cuts UK Labour lead in Scotland.</headline>
<dateline>GLASGOW 1996-09-02</dateline>
<text>
<p>Labour's about-turn over a separate Scottish parliament has cut its lead over the pro-independence Scottish National Party (SNP) by nine points, an opinion poll showed on Monday.</p>
<p>The monthly System Three poll published in the Herald newspaper gave Labour 48 percent support, SNP 29, Conservatives unchanged on 15, and Liberal Democrats down three to seven.</p>
<p>Party squabbles over leader Tony Blair's plan to hold a two-question devolution referendum if Labour wins an election -- to be held before May 1997 helped the SNP surge six points.  </p>
<p>The poll was held in 39 of Scotland's 72 constituencies between August 21 and 26, before Labour's Scottish executive met on Saturday to consider the referendum plan.</p>
<p>A narrow victory for Blair was complicated by a call for a second referendum before a Scottish parliament used tax-raising powers. Opponents and some party dissidents said this showed Labour was back-tracking over home rule for Scotland.</p>
<p>Labour originally pledged a separate Scottish parliament if it won the election but three months ago Blair said he planned a two-question referendum first.  </p>
<p>Prime Minister John Major says keeping the 300-year old union between England and Scotland will top his election agenda.</p>
<p>Labour has 49 Scottish M.Ps, Conservatives 10, Liberal Democrats 9, and SNP four. In the 1992 election Labour won 39 percent of the Scots vote, Conservatives 26, SNP 22, and Liberal Democrats 13.</p>
