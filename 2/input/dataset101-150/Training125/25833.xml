<p>British Labour Party leader Tony Blair won a narrow victory on Saturday when the party's Scottish executive voted 21-18 in favour of his plans for a referendum on a separate parliament for Scotland.</p>
<p>Blair once pledged to set up a Scottish parliament if the Labour won the next general election, which must be held by May 1997.</p>
<p>But many activists were dismayed when he abruptly decided earlier this year to hold a two-question referendum on the issue, asking Scots if they wanted a separate parliament and if it should have tax-raising powers.</p>
<p>Many party members argued that a general election win would demonstrate popular support for a separate parliament and others said a single question referendum would suffice.</p>
<p>Prime Minister John Major says the 300-year-old union of the Scottish and English parliaments will be a main plank in his Conservative Party's election platform.</p>
<p>Conservatives have only 10 of the 72 Scottish seats in parliament and consistently run third in opinion polls in Scotland behind Labour and the independence-seeking Scottish National Party.</p>
