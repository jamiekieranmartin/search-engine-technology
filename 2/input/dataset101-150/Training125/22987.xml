<dateline>LONDON 1996-08-29</dateline>

<p>Britain's ruling Conservatives have cut the 24-point lead of the opposition Labour Party by three points over the past month, according to a poll published in Thursday's edition of the Times newspaper.</p>
<p>But Labour still enjoys a huge 21 point-cushion with at most nine months to go before a general election, the poll conducted by the MORI organisation said.</p>
<p>It gave the Conservatives the backing of 30 percent of Britons, up one point from July, against 51 percent for Labour, down two. The Liberal Democrats were on 13 percent, up one point.</p>
<p>Prime Minister John Major has indicated he plans to hold a general election close to the last possible date of May 1997, hoping that economic growth will gradually attract electors back to his party despite its deep internal splits over Europe.</p>
<p>The poll, in which 1,705 people were interviewed, was conducted between August 20 and 25.  REUTER</p>
