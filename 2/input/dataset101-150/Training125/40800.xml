<p>Opposition leader Tony Blair said on Monday he expected the ruling Conservatives to fight the dirtiest-ever election campaign and warned members of his Labour party not to take their big lead in opinion polls for granted.</p>
<p>In a speech in Aberdeen overshadowed by recent disarray over the party's plans for a referendum on its proposed Scottish parliament, Blair said he would continue to put the positive case for Labour in the run-up to the election, due by next May.</p>
<p>But he said: &quot;The Tories will fight the most negative campaign in the history of modern politics. They will tell lies about Labour. They will use the only weapon they have after running the most discredited government in modern times -- fear.</p>
<p>&quot;We can take nothing for granted. The changes we have made have put us in a strong position but we will have to fight for every vote, for every seat.&quot;</p>
<p>Rising living standards are starting to help the Conservatives' poll ratings but Labour, in opposition since 1979, retains a handsome lead of about 20 percentage points.</p>
<p>Prime Minister John Major, like Blair, is already campaigning hard.</p>
<p>On a visit to western England on Monday, Major reaffirmed his objective of a basic income tax rate of 20 percent -- the rate was cut to 24 percent from 25 percent in last November's budget -- and said his government was looking at ways of dealing with public-sector strikes.</p>
<p>Blair denied that Labour's decision last week to drop plans for a second referendum on whether its proposed Scottish parliament should be able to raise taxes represented a U-turn.</p>
<p>&quot;We have not changed our policies in any way. What we have done is to set out honestly before the election how our plans can be achieved,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>If the episode had been difficult, it was because the Labour leadership had been honest about its intentions: the easiest option would have been to stay silent until after the election.</p>
<p>&quot;But when hard choices have to be made we will make them, not only on this issue but on others too,&quot; Blair said.</p>
