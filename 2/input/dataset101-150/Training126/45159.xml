<p>China's National Nuclear Safety Administration has certified the Daya Bay nuclear power plant in southern Guangdong province for formal operation, the Xinhua news agency said.</p>
<p>The plant, just over the border from the British colony of Hong Kong, was granted certification after a three-year trial commercial operation period, the agency said in a report late on Monday.</p>
<p>The station, outfitted with two 900-megawatt reactors, was China's first nuclear power plant to go into formal operation, Xinhua said.</p>
<p>Workers at the plant had solved problems that touched on safety issues, it said without giving details.</p>
<p>The Daya Bay plant was shut down in March this year when problems with the Unit Two exciter, a non-nuclear component, coincided with the refuelling of the other unit.</p>
<p>A company spokesman then said the defect was not relevant to safety or radioactivity.</p>
<p>Problems with Unit One's reactor control rods while Unit Two was being refuelled forced the shutdown of the plant in April 1995.  </p>
<p>A unit of Hong Kong's China Light &amp; Power Co Ltd has a 25 percent stake in the operator of the plant.</p>
<p>Daya Bay's Unit 2 was built by the French state-owned nuclear power group Framatome, in which Alcatel Alsthom owns a substantial stake.</p>
