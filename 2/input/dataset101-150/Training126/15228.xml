<p>South Korea plans to build 19 nuclear power plants as part of a long-term effort to keep pace with growing demand for power, an official of the Korea Electric Power Corp said on Monday.</p>
<p>The nuclear plants, which include two super-sized plants of 1,300 megawatts each, would lift the share of nuclear-generated power in Korea to 33.1 percent of total power-making capacity, Woo-Chang Cho, deputy manager of the power planning department of Korea Electric told an energy conference in Sydney.</p>
<p>Construction of the first of the larger-sized plants could begin as early as next year, Cho said.  </p>
<p>In 1994, nuclear power held 26.5 percent of the market, Cho said. If all the nuclear plants are built, it would represent 26,329 megawats of power, Cho said.</p>
<p>To meet overall demand for electricity, Cho said a currrent development plan calls for a total of 122 power plants to be built. South Korea is looking at constructing 29 coal-fired plants, 40 liquified natural gas plants, 11 oil-fired plants and 23 hydro and other plants, Cho said.</p>
<p>At the same time, a total of 6,190 megawatss od capacity would be retired, Cho said.  </p>
<p>Electricity consumption in South Korea has been increasing an average of 12 percent a year for the last 15 years, Cho said.</p>
<p>In the short-term, peak load will continue to increase, owing to a rapid rise in the use of cooling appliances, he said.</p>
<p>Capital investments of between US$3 billion and $4 billion a year is required to meet the new demand, Cho said.</p>
<p>The plan calls for a further 38 plant sites, although only 22 sites have been secured so far, he said.</p>
<p>Obtaining sites is becoming more difficult because of opposition from local communities, Cho said.  </p>
<p>Electric power demand has a tendency to be concentrated high-density populated areas, while power plants are located in remote places, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;This causes difficulties in maintaing supply stability and high transmission loss,&quot; Cho said.</p>
