<p>The Czech government's tourism office on Wednesday forecast record income from foreign visits in 1996, as &quot;Golden Prague&quot; and its environs put a silver lining in otherwise dreary Czech trade figures.</p>
<p>Income from foreign visitors, crucial in stemming the Czech current account deficit, could surge to top $3.5 billion this year, up from a record $2.87 billion in 1995, director Jiri Cech of the Economics Ministry's tourism division told Reuters.</p>
<p>He said 1996 record revenue from tourism in the Czech Republic, which has yet to see any slowing in the flood of tourists which burst in after the end of Communism in 1989, would range &quot;from $3.2 to $3.5 billion or more&quot;.</p>
<p>The Czech National Bank balance of payment figures for the first half of the year -- which will give clearer picture of the balance of services -- are expected to be released in the first half of September.</p>
<p>The tourism component of the first quarter balance of payments showed a net inflow of $261 million with total tourism receipts of $581 million, and analysts have forecast first half total tourism revenues at about $1.6 billion.</p>
<p>The overall current account however posted a $505 million deficit in the first quarter, mostly due to a ballooning merchandise trade deficit.</p>
<p>The trade deficit in goods has accelerated in recent months, and a record gap in July of 16.4 billion crowns ($627 million) raised the seven-month 1996 deficit to 85.3 billion crowns ($3.26 billion).</p>
<p>Economists are forecasting the 1996 current account deficit at between five to six percent of gross domestic product, compared with about four percent last year.</p>
<p>But just in the first half of the year, record tourist visits to the country, and especially to the historical centre of the capital Prague where tourists often outnumber residents in the high season, topped most expectations.</p>
<p>The overall number of tourist visits in the country was up 11.6 percent in the first half, year-on-year, to 44.7 million and airport arrivals were up 48.4 percent to 7.3 million, according to the Czech Statistical Bureau.</p>
<p>Czech foreign travel abroad rose 10.2 percent in the first half of the year to 4.3 million visits abroad for a country of 10.4 million residents. Czechs spent $320 million abroad in the first quarter.</p>
<p>Independent analysts are forecasting a surplus in the Czech balance of services, including tourism of $1.8 to $2.0 billion this year. ($1=26.17 Czech Crowns)</p>
