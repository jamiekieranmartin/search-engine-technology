<p>A group of Protestant &quot;Loyalist&quot; women jeered Irish President Mary Robinson on Thursday when she paid a one-day visit to the British-ruled province of Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>They shouted at Robinson as she visited a women's centre to air their disgust at what they see as Ireland's support for IRA guerrilla attempts to end British rule.</p>
<p>The Irish President made light of the incident which she blamed on sectarian tension spilling over from a summer of violent demonstrations and counter-protests by the Protestant majority and Catholic minority.</p>
<p>It exploded on July 12 when violent Protestant protests forced police to scrap a ban on an Orange Order parade through a Catholic section of the rural town of Portadown.</p>
<p>&quot;After the summer we have had it is not surprising that there are some fears, it is not surprising that there is some distrust,&quot; said Robinson.</p>
<p>She also had her first public meeting with Gerry Adams, president of the Irish Republican Army's IRA guerrilla wing, when she toured Catholic, Irish nationalist parts of Belfast.</p>
<p>Robinson said the meeting had no special significance. A handshake with Adams behind closed doors two years ago caused outrage in the Loyalist community.</p>
<p>Robinson said her visit had no special political agenda but was part of her continued bridge-building efforts which have taken her to Northern Ireland several times in recent years.</p>
<p>Her main engagement was to attend a conference of European Methodist Churches.</p>
<p>Ireland's constitution lays claim to the province and its people but successive governments have backed attempts to forge a lasting political settlement.</p>
<p>Robinson, whose role in Irish politics is largely ceremonial, has called on the two communities to foster peace through community contact.</p>
<p>The province has been on edge since the IRA ended a 17-month ceasefire in February this year with attacks on British targets in London and Germany.</p>
<p>A parallel truce by Protestant guerrillas fighting to maintain British rule is still in force but spokesmen for the guerrillas say it is at risk because of the IRA campaign.</p>
