<p>Thailand's demand for raw materials such as soymeal and corn for animal feed could be affected by a recent cabinet decision to allow live pigs imports from Malaysia, industry sources said on Monday.</p>
<p>They said that while the short-term impact would be limited, the decision to import pigs may have a longer-term implication for the feed industry.</p>
<p>The Thai cabinet last week allowed imports of 30,000 pigs a month until December.</p>
<p>The government said the move was being made to ease pork prices. There is an apparent pig shortage in Thailand because of high animal feed prices that have reduced incentives to increase breeding.</p>
<p>But food price inflation has been marked in consumer price indices released in recent months by the Commerce Ministry.</p>
<p>In the August consumer price index, food prices were noted to have risen by 2.3 percent month-on-month while non-food prices were stable.</p>
<p>Imports could force small pig farms out of business and affect the overall cycle of pig raising, a source from Thailand's Swine Association said.</p>
<p>&quot;This could make the country more and more dependent on imported pigs as the wicked cycle repeats,&quot; the source said. &quot;And it could in turn affect the feedmill industry and the country's demand for animal feed raw material as well.&quot;</p>
<p>Although in the short term, any new imports of pigs would have a negligible effect on feed demand, there was a danger that it could have a negative effect in the longer term, industry sources said.</p>
<p>They said it took about 350 kg of feed to raise a 100-kg pig.</p>
<p>&quot;Therefore, the 120,000 pigs to be imported would translate into only about 42,000 tonnes of feed,&quot; a Continental trader said.</p>
<p>&quot;But we are more concerned about the long-term outlook. This (cabinet resolution) was political. It failed to address the real problem,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The trader said the real solution to the problem was to liberalise the imports of raw materials for animal feed and cut restrictive tariffs.</p>
<p>&quot;The industry is facing a 15 percent tariff on soymeal, three percent on corn and five percent on soybean. That will have to reflect in the pork prices,&quot; he said.</p>
