<p>Israel's Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd faces a key hurdle in its drive to become a full-fledged drug maker on Thursday when takes its multiple sclerosis drug before a U.S. regulatory panel.</p>
<p>Teva has been known as a leading generic pharmaceutical company. But it will be taking its own drug, Copaxone, before a U.S. Food and Drug Advisory panel that will vote whether to recommend the product receive final U.S. marketing approval.  </p>
<p>Copaxone's fate will be a major factor in Teva's growth outlook and whether Wall Street gives the company's stock a higher earnings multiple granted so-called research-based drug companies, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;Copaxone clearly changes the nature of the company,&quot; Dillon Read analyst Jerry Treppel said.</p>
<p>Teva had previously said the FDA had told it no advisory meeting would be needed for the drug's approval. But its stock sold off in July after the company said a meeting would in fact be needed, giving rise to speculation that the FDA had doubts about the drug.  </p>
<p>But most analysts expect a favorable vote from the Peripheral and Central Nervous System Drugs Advisory Committee and Teva's shares have rebounded in recent weeks. The move has left the stock more room to tumble if the drug is rejected and less to gain from a positive panel vote, analysts said.</p>
<p>NatWest Securities analyst Jack Lamberton said in a report on Wednesday that a positive review could send the stock over $50 and final approval in the fourth quarter could lead to a drive over $60. A negative meeting for Teva could sink its stock below $30, Lamberton said.</p>
<p>Teva's shares were up 3/8 to 44-3/8 in Nasdaq trading.  </p>
<p>&quot;If there's a glitch (at the meeting) it will not only affect patients with MS, it will affect the stock,&quot; Gruntal Investment Research analyst David Saks said.</p>
<p>Analysts estimate the drug could have worldwide sales of $300 million by the year 2000, given a late 1996 or early 1997 final FDA approval. Teva had 1995 sales of $668 million.</p>
<p>Hoechst AG's Hoechst Marion Roussel drug unit is Teva's marketing partner for Copaxone.</p>
<p>The National Multiple Sclerosis Society estimates there are between 250,000 to 350,000 people in the U.S. with the central nervous system disease. There are no cures for MS.  </p>
<p>If approved, Copaxone will go up against two FDA-approved MS treatments. Chiron Corp's Betaseron, marketed by Schering AG and launched in July 1993, and Biogen Inc's Avonex, introduced in May.</p>
<p>Betaseron carries a claim on its label that it reduces flare-ups of MS, while Avonex carries an additional claim that it slows the disease's progression.</p>
<p>Analysts said they expect Copaxone's labeling to be limited to a claim of reducing flare-ups of the disease.</p>
<p>&quot;I think for most patients, (slowing the) progression is clearly the issue,&quot; said Oppenheimer and Co's Sharon Seiler.  </p>
<p>MS leads to the degeneration of the sheath of myelin protecting the nerves in the brain and spinal cord, leading to patients slowly losing control of their movement, speech and bodily functions.</p>
<p>Unlike Betaseron and Avonex, which are forms of proteins known as interferons, Copaxone is made up of four amino acids that work by inhibiting the destruction of the myelin sheath.</p>
<p>This new approach to mitigating the disease could be a factor boosting Copaxone's chances for approval as well as a marketing angle, analysts said.</p>
<p>With no &quot;magic bullet&quot; cure for the disease, patients and doctors will want as many viable weapons as possible, Treppel said. &quot;I can't imagine that physicians wouldn't want this in their armamentarium,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Analysts noted that the lack of strong backing from the FDA panel would be a setback, but Teva's recent FDA approvals for generic drugs to treat seizures and ulcers will cushion the meeting's impact on the company's outlook.</p>
