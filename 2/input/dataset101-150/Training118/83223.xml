<p>Seven mental patients of the Philippines' National Centre for Mental Health died in the past three days from severe dehydration, officials said on Saturday.</p>
<p>More than 50 others were confined to its infirmary due to diarrhoea, physician Judith Mercado said. Tests showed that most of them were suffering from cholera. Mercado said those in the infirmary had been rehydrated and were out of danger.</p>
<p>Government health official Concepcion Roces said the outbreak was due to poor personal hygiene among male patients, and ruled out contaminated drinking water. Several cholera cases due to contaminated water, have been reported in Manila hospitals in recent weeks.</p>
