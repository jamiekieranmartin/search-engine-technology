<p>U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued a national alert on a drug that has been used to help people lose weight and reduce drug abuse, saying it was causing dangerous infections that could be fatal.</p>
<p>The FDA said in a statement released on Friday it had ordered the drug off the market and was investigating its makers and distributors.</p>
<p>It said it had received dozens of complaints from people who suffering from abscesses on parts of their bodies where the adrenal cortex extract had been injected.</p>
<p>The drug comes in a 30-milliliter vial from Hallmark Labs that is distributed by Phyne Pharmaceuticals of Scottsdale, Arizona, it said.</p>
<p>The administration said it had never approved the use of the extract, which comes from the adrenal glands of sheep and other animals.</p>
<p>The administration said the abscesses might have occurred because the drug had been poorly prepared or labelled.</p>
<p>Phyne officials could not be immediately reached for comment.</p>
