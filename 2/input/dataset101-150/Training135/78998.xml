<p>Economic reform pursued by Colombia over the past six years have boosted the politically- troubled Latin American country's integration into the world economy, the World Trade Organisation said on Thursday.</p>
<p>In a report on Colombian trade policies, WTO analysts said the so-called &quot;Apertura&quot; trade liberalisation programme launched in 1990 had brought down tariffs and non-tariff barriers to imports and led to openings for foreign service providers.</p>
<p>This nationally-initiated process had been given further impetus by wider commitments to opening up its previously highly-protected markets for goods and services taken on in the 1986-93 Uruguay Round world trade negotiations.</p>
<p>&quot;The opening of the economy has created new investment oportunities, which should also be encouraged by improved macroeconomic stability, solid growth and ongoing fiscal reforms,&quot; the WTO analysts said.</p>
<p>The agreements reached in the Round, held under the old General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), were finalised in a world treaty signed in Morocco in 1994, clearing the way for the launch of the WTO to replace the GATT in 1995.</p>
<p>Colombia, one of the major economies in Latin America, said in its own report to the WTO that since the organisation had started operations it had recognised the advantages it could offer to an emerging economy.</p>
<p>&quot;We have perceived the benefits which may derive from a rule-based system and more precise disciplines, as well as from a strengthened dispute-settlement mechanism which can guarantee the effective functioning of the multi-lateral trading system,&quot; the Bogota government said.</p>
<p>The rules of the WTO which prevent countries blocking rulings by neutral panels in trade disputes are widely seen by developing countries as giving them firmer ground than under the GATT to challenge the big trading powers.</p>
<p>While very few small economies took complaints to the GATT, developing countries are involved in many of the over 50 disputes already brought to the WTO, encouraged by the very first panel ruling which found in favour of Venezuela against the United States.</p>
<p>Many feel the big powers -- including the United States, Colombia's main trading partner, and the European Union -- have been slow to open up markets to their products while they have adapted national policies to the new overall trade rules.</p>
<p>An echo of this came in the Colombian report.</p>
<p>While Colombia was confident the benefits of the new world trading system would be shared, it said, this could be achieved &quot;if the supply of exports from the developing countries such as Colombia is treated in the same way as products and services from developed countries.&quot;</p>
<p>The WTO analysts noted that Colombia -- linked in the Andean Pact with Bolivia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela -- was looking for new agreements with Latin American partners which would bring an expansion of regional trade growth.</p>
<p>But the country was also looking for trade opportunities beyond the region and was actively engaged in negotiations to establish a free trade area for the Americas.</p>
