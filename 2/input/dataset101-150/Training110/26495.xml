<p>Palestinians will declare an independent Palestinian state with Arab East Jerusalem as its capital if Israel refuses to resume talks on a final peace agreement, a PLO official said on Sunday.</p>
<p>The statement by Faisal al-Husseini, the PLO's top official in Jerusalem, was another sign of tension in Israeli-Palestinian relations that in the last week dropped to their lowest point since Benjamin Netanyahu was elected prime minister last May.</p>
<p>&quot;We will declare a Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital if Israel refuses to start permanent status negotiations,&quot; Husseini told foreign reporters based in Israel.</p>
<p>&quot;But as long as we start permanent status negotiations, we are not going to do that, it will not be the time for it.&quot;</p>
<p>Interim self-rule deals signed by Israel and the PLO since 1993 set the framework for negotiations on the final status of the West Bank, Gaza and Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Final status talks got under way in a symbolic session under the previous Labour-led government but there have been no such negotiations since Netanyahu took power on a platform rejecting the exchange of occupied territory for peace.</p>
<p>Palestinian President Yasser Arafat warned Israel on Friday that Palestinians had other options if the Jewish state did not honour its agreements with the PLO.</p>
<p>One option, he said, was the possible resumption of the six-year-long Palestinian uprising that began in 1987.</p>
<p>Arafat said the other choice was unilateral declaration of an independent Palestinian state, to which Israel objects.</p>
<p>Palestinian officials said although the PLO had declared a state from exile in 1988, such a call now would have more significance because Arafat was in charge of self-rule areas in the West Bank and Gaza.</p>
<p>PLO officials have accused Israel of trying to back out of deals reached with the government of former prime minister Shimon Peres, particularly an agreed Israeli troop redeployment in the West Bank city of Hebron.</p>
<p>&quot;This government is creating an atmosphere which will lead to explosion. There will be explosion if the agreements are not implemented,&quot; Husseini said. &quot;On the issue of Jerusalem things have reached the point of explosion.&quot;</p>
<p>Under Israeli pressure, the Palestinian Authority closed two offices in East Jerusalem last week which Israel contended had engaged in activity connnected with self-rule, which under the peace deals is confined to parts of the West Bank and Gaza. Palestinian leaders denied the Israeli charge.</p>
<p>Angering Palestinians further, Israel demolished a community centre in East Jerusalem last Tuesday. Municipal authorities said the building had been constructed without a permit.</p>
<p>Israel occupied East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war and later annexed it, a move not recognised by the international community. Israel declared both halves of the city its united capital.</p>
