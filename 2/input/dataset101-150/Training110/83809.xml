<p>Israel on Sunday reopened the tunnel at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian fighting that President Bill Clinton hopes to end with an Arafat-Netanyahu summit in Washington this week.</p>
<p>Clinton said he had called Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Yasser Arafat to a meeting in Washington with the leaders of Jordan and Egypt.</p>
<p>Clinton, fearing his Middle East peace policy could unravel five weeks before the U.S. presidential election, announced the summit before receiving formal notice the Palestinians and Egyptians would attend.</p>
<p>Diplomats said the United States had not secured agreement on the main issues to ensure that the summit would be a success.</p>
<p>Arafat was trying to convince Hosni Mubarak to attend, PLO officials said. Arafat wants Egypt as a counterweight to the United States, Israel's ally.</p>
<p>&quot;The government of Israel welcomes the president's initiative to call the parties to come to Washington. This was our aim,&quot; cabinet secretary Danny Naveh told reporters.</p>
<p>Previously Netanyahu, leader of the right-wing Likud party, has insisted on bilateral Palestinian-Israeli talks in the region to shield Israel from international pressure.</p>
<p>&quot;We want to renew negotiations with the Palestinians in order to achieve real results on the ground. But first of all what we need here is a stop of any violent activities,&quot; Naveh said.</p>
<p>Netanyahu has rejected Arafat's demand to close the tunnel. Arafat also wants an Israeli timetable for extending stalled Palestinian self-rule, including an Israeli redeployment in occupied Hebron.</p>
<p>The U.S. diplomatic drive came against a backdrop of continued tension in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Fifty-five Palestinians and 14 Israeli soldiers have died in clashes since Israel opened the tunnel last Tuesday.</p>
<p>Israeli officials raised the spectre of disarming Palestinian police if gunbattles resumed. More Israeli tanks moved into positions around PLO-ruled areas of the West Bank and Gaza, witnesses said. Palestinian police said they were closely watching the Israeli moves which they saw as sabre-rattling.</p>
<p>Security sources said Israel had implemented the first phase of &quot;Operation Field of Thorns&quot;, a plan whose final third stage is the retaking of West Bank and Gaza areas handed over to Arafat under the 1993 Oslo self-rule agreement.</p>
<p>The sources said the army had no intention at present of implementing the final phase which would amount to a war with Arafat's more than 30,000 lightly armed police.</p>
<p>Foreign military analysts and diplomats believe Arafat would leave Gaza if Netanyahu's right-wing government scrapped the self-rule Oslo accord.</p>
<p>Palestinian stone-throwers clashed with Israeli soldiers in sporadic unrest but the West Bank and Gaza were quieter than they have been since Netanyahu opened the archaeological tunnel which Palestinians see as an illegal act on occupied land and an assault on Moslem holy places.</p>
<p>Youths hurled stones when the tunnel's new second entrance from the Old City's Moslem Quarter was re-opened after the Jewish sabbath. The protests were quickly quelled by police.</p>
<p>Many foreign governments and the Israeli opposition parties have called Netanyahu's move a blunder that Arafat has exploited to shore up his standing among Palestinians, deeply frustrated with Oslo and Israeli foot-dragging on implementing self-rule.</p>
<p>The United States, however, has tried to shield its ally. It cast the lone abstention when the 14 other members of the U.N. Security Council called for ensuring the safety of Palestinian civilians and for the immediate resumption of the Middle East peace process on Saturday.</p>
<p>Netanyahu aide David Bar-Illan said Israel should consider disarming Palestinian police if fighting resumes.</p>
<p>&quot;For now we aren't thinking of that. But if such things will continue and such incidents will recur, we will have to think about that also,&quot; Bar-Illan told Israel Radio.</p>
<p>Bar-Illan said Israel would also have to rethink its long-delayed handover of parts of the West Bank city of Hebron to Palestinian rule in light of the gunfights that erupted between its soldiers and Palestinian police.</p>
<p>On the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, shares continued to fall. &quot;Events had a very negative impact on investors and most of them are sitting on the fence,&quot; said a trader at Israel's Bank Leumi.</p>
