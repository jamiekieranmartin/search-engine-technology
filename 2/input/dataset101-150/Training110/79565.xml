<p>Israeli and Palestinian forces fought gun battles in the West Bank and Gaza on Thursday. The toll of dead and wounded from two days of unprecedented clashes grew rapidly.</p>
<p>The fighting was fierce and widespread and dashed U.S. hopes of keeping alive Arab-Israeli peace talks, stalled since right-wing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu came to power 100 days ago.</p>
<p>The death toll mounted rapidly and by mid-afternoon 29 Palestinians and five Israelis were reported killed in the two days of fighting.</p>
<p>Medical sources in the Palestinian areas said Israeli troops had shot dead 24 Palestinian police and civilians on Thursday. Clashes erupted near Jewish settlements in the Gaza Strip and near the PLO-ruled enclave of Ramallah, north of Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Two Israeli soldiers were killed when hundreds of Palestinians charged an army post near the isolated Netzarim Jewish settlement south of Gaza City, Israel Radio said. It said two other Israelis were killed in the West Bank town of Nablus, at the tomb of the biblical Joseph. A fifth Israeli was also reported killed.</p>
<p>Palestinians said more than 250 Palestinians were wounded in the West Bank and 50 in Gaza. Israel Radio said more than 30 Israelis were injured.</p>
<p>Netanyahu cut short a visit to Germany to return home to handle the crisis which Israeli media called a war.</p>
<p>Netanyahu and Palestinian Yasser Arafat spoke by telephone and discussed the possibility of a meeting to end the fighting, Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh told Israel Radio.</p>
<p>Netanyahu called Arafat from Bonn and urged him to take &quot;strident action&quot; to calm the protest, sparked by Israel's decision to open a controversial archaeological tunnel in Arab East Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Arafat's Palestinian Authority urged Arab states to isolate and punish Israel.</p>
<p>The Palestinian delegate to the Arab League, Mohamed Sobeih, made the appeal at the start of a one-day Arab League meeting in Cairo.</p>
<p>&quot;Palestinian land has been turned into fields of war, on which many martyrs have fallen,&quot; Sobeih said.</p>
<p>Washington, which has spent the past five years trying to build Middle East peace, worked frantically behind the scenes to stop the fighting.</p>
<p>&quot;We are trying as hard as we can, the United States, to stop the violence and get the two sides back talking about their problems&quot; U.S. Consul General in Jerusalem, Edward Abington said, touring the scene of the Ramallah clashes in an armoured limousine.</p>
<p>Britain expressed grave concern at the upsurge of violence and urged Israeli and Palestinian leaders to show &quot;statesmanship&quot; to halt the fighting. The Foreign Office said the Middle East peace process was in a precarious state.</p>
<p>French President Jacques Chirac telephoned Arafat on Thursday to express support and appeal for calm, the president's office said. Chirac met Netanyahu in Paris on Wednesday.</p>
<p>In a 20-minute phone call, Chirac &quot;assured (Arafat) of his solidarity and support after the grave incidents in the Palestinian territories&quot;, the president's office said.</p>
<p>The French Foreign Ministry blamed Israel for triggering the riots and said they were a worrying throwback to the 1987-93 Palestinian uprising.</p>
<p>Arab anger at Netanyahu's failure to extend self-rule in the West Bank and Gaza boiled over after his Likud government opened a tunnel near the al-Aqsa and Dome of the Rock mosques.</p>
<p>Palestinians accuse Israel of trying to Judaise Arab East Jerusalem, which they consider to be illegally occupied by the Jewish state.</p>
<p>Israeli Defence Minister Yizhak Mordechai questioned the decision to open the tunnel. &quot;I don't know whether to say with finality that...all considerations were taken into account,&quot; he told reporters.</p>
<p>Stone-throwing, the traditional form of protest during the 1987-93 intifada, gave way to gunfire as Palestinian youths urged Arafat's 30,000-strong police force to join their battle.</p>
<p>Israeli soldiers fired from two helicopters at police on top of apartment houses near Ramallah. They fired from an armoured personnel carrier outside Joseph's Tomb in Nablus, witnesses said. Jewish settlers also opened fire in Ramallah.</p>
<p>Three branches of Arafat's paramilitary police fired at Israeli jeeps from behind concrete blocks at a checkpoint near Kfar Darom settlement in the centre of the Gaza Strip.</p>
<p>&quot;Stop throwing stones, this will not help now,&quot; a Palestinian officer shouted. His words were drowned out by the crackle of automatic rifle fire from members of Arafat's Preventive Security force and the Coast Guard.</p>
<p>Among others killed in Gaza was a girl aged between 14 and 16 years, health officials said.</p>
<p>In Ramallah Palestinian Colonel Ribhi Arafat arrived with troops at the scene of the clashes trying to arrange a ceasefire with the Israelis, witnesses said. Shortly after gunfire died down.</p>
<p>Israel handed Gaza over to the PLO in 1994 but some 3,000 Jews still live there in fortified enclaves on some 40 percent of the land. Settlement, revived by Netanyahu, has been one of the issues stoking Palestinian frustration with the Oslo self-rule deal signed in 1993.</p>
<p>Shares on the Israeli stock market fell on the unrest. The benchmark Mishtanim index of the top 100 shares opened down 2.5 percent at 191.65 points. Thurday's expiration of options on the Maof index also contributed to the fall.</p>
