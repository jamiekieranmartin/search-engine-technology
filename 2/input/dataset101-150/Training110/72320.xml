<p>British Prime Minister John Major and visiting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hailed the state of relations between their countries on Tuesday but admitted to disagreements over the Middle East peace process.</p>
<p>&quot;The bilateral relationship between Israel and the United Kingdom is in as good a shape today as I can ever remember it being,&quot; Major told reporters after more than an hour of talks at his Downing Street residence.</p>
<p>Netanyahu, on his first visit to Europe since becoming prime minister in June, said the commitment that he and Major shared toward peace was guided by two principles -- the idea of security as a basis for peace and the importance of both sides to a conflict fulfilling their obligations.</p>
<p>Israel says it will move ahead with the peace process only if the Palestine Liberation Organisation keeps to a promise to crack down on attacks by Islamic militants.</p>
<p>&quot;Fighting terrorism is as important for Palestinians and Israelis alike.</p>
<p>&quot;The idea that terrorism and the peace process are compatible is unacceptable. I think it's something that many in Britain would understand -- and rightly so,&quot; Netanyahu said, referring to Britain's efforts to persuade the Irish Republican Army to renounce violence.</p>
<p>Britain is demanding that IRA guerrillas fighting against British rule of Northern Ireland restore a ceasefire before they can join all-party talks on the future of the province.</p>
<p>Britain and Israel stood almost alone in giving unreserved support for this month's U.S. offensive against Iraq, and Netanyahu thanked Major for his diplomatic support for the Middle East peace process.</p>
<p>But he also alluded to differences.</p>
<p>&quot;I found common ground on a number of central issues (but) I don't want to say that Israel and Britain have exactly the same foreign policies,&quot; the Israeli leader said.</p>
<p>Major was asked whether Israel's plans to expand Jewish settlements in the West Bank, which Britain deems illegal, was among the areas of disagreement.</p>
<p>&quot;We discussed a whole range of issues but I think one of the aspects of our relationship is where we have matters to discuss, we speak as frank and candid friends and we do so in private.</p>
<p>&quot;Our interest in the United Kingdom is trying to provide a rapprochement to problems, not adding to them,&quot; Major replied.</p>
<p>Netanyahu will meet opposition Labour Party leader Tony Blair and former prime minister Margaret Thatcher on Wednesday.</p>
<p>He then flies to Paris for talks with President Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Alain Juppe before travelling to Bonn on Thursday to meet Chancellor Helmut Kohl.</p>
