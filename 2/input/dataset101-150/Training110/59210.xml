<p>Israel on Tuesday demolished the second storey of a Palestinian home in Jerusalem's Old City which it said had been built illegally, police and witnesses said.</p>
<p>The Israeli municipality of Jerusalem said in a statement that the demolition was carried out after the owner of the building lost an appeal to Israel's High Court to delay implementation of the demolition order.</p>
<p>A Jerusalem police spokesman said the demolition was carried out by municipal employees under heavy police guard.</p>
<p>Witnesses said Palestinians scuffled with police as workmen used jackhammers to punch through the walls of the second storey of the home owned by a Palestinian family located on the edge of the Old City's Armenian quarter.</p>
<p>No one was hurt in the scuffles. Palestinians in the area shut their shops in protest.</p>
<p>Faisal al-Husseini, the leading Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) official in Jerusalem, told Reuters Israel was trying to drive the Palestinians from the city holy to Moslems, Christians and Jews.</p>
<p>&quot;Actually, what they are trying to do is weaken the Palestinian presence in Jerusalem,&quot; Husseini said.</p>
<p>It was the second time in less than a month that Israel moved against an Arab-owned property inside the Old City.</p>
<p>On August 27, Israel enraged Palestinians by demolishing a building in the Old City intended to be a Palestinian community centre it said had been funded by the Palestinian self-rule Authority.</p>
<p>Israel says under interim peace deals the Palestinian Authority is restricted to operating only in areas of the West Bank and Gaza Strip handed to them by Israel.</p>
<p>A Palestinian human rights group said last week Israel had told 12 Arab families in the West Bank village of Sur Baher on the outskirts of Jerusalem that their homes would be demolished because they were built without permits.</p>
<p>Israel captured Arab East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed it. Palestinians want East Jerusalem to be the capital of a future state. Israel says it will never to cede any part of the city it calls its eternal, united capital.</p>
<p>The issue is to be negotiated at final status peace talks which have yet to resume under Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who ousted the previous centre-left government in May elections.</p>
