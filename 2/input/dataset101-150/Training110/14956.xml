<p>PLO officials said on Monday Israel had no right to demand closure of three Palestinian offices in Arab East Jerusalem but it had shut two to deprive Israel's prime minister of any excuse to slow peace moves.</p>
<p>They rejected Israel's charge the offices were carrying out activities of the Palestinian Authority, which according to an interim peace accord is restricted to working in self-rule enclaves set up under the deal in Gaza and the West Bank.</p>
<p>&quot;When these offices, which they claim are Palestinian Authority offices, are closed, we will strip Israel of any false excuses to continue freezing the peace process,&quot; one official of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) said.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect Israel now to reopen talks and to fulfil its commitments,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office meanwhile denied a report by Israel's state-run Channel One that said he would meet Palestinian President Yasser Arafat in two weeks.</p>
<p>Netanyahu has said he will hold talks with Arafat only when he deems it necessary for Israel's security.</p>
<p>Israeli President Ezer Weizman, answering a &quot;distress&quot; call from Arafat, said on Sunday he would invite the Palestinian leader to his home but set no date.</p>
<p>Weizman made the announcement at a hurriedly called news conference with Netanyahu hours after a newspaper said he had threatened to meet Arafat over Netanyahu's objections.</p>
<p>PLO officials said Israel demanded the Authority shut the Jerusalem offices at a meeting between Netanyahu envoys and Palestinian officials in Gaza last week.</p>
<p>They said the envoys pledged in return to resume peace talks and implement a redeployment of Israeli troops in the West Bank town of Hebron agreed by Israel's previous government in a signed accord.</p>
<p>Palestinians view the Hebron withdrawal as a litmus test of Netanyahu's intentions on Middle East peace moves.</p>
<p>The Israeli envoys said peace talks, stalled since Netanyahu's election in May, would resume before September 2.</p>
<p>The offices closed were the Maps and Survey Department and the Sports and Youth Office. The head of a third institution Israel had demanded be closed, a vocational school, is continuing to refuse to close his organisation.</p>
<p>PLO officials said all the offices which Israel wanted closed were licensed by previous Israeli governments and were set up before the 1993 PLO-Israel peace deal.</p>
<p>A Palestinian lawmaker who angered Israel at the start of August when he opened an office in his home in East Jerusalem said on Monday city taxmen seized his furniture. He said the move came despite his having a payment plan for the taxes.</p>
<p>A Jerusalem city spokeswoman said there was no payment plan and rejected Hatem Abdel-Qader's charge of harassment.</p>
<p>Israel captured East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war and later annexed it against international opposition. It has declared both halves of the city its eternal capital.</p>
<p>Palestinians view East Jerusalem as the capital of a future state. The city's fate is up for negotiation at final peace talks which have yet to resume under Netanyahu.</p>
