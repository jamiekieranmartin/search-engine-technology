<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will visit Paris for talks with French President Jacques Chirac at the end of this month, Chirac's office said on Monday.</p>
<p>The meeting, an apparent part of France's drive to play a bigger peace-making role in the Middle East, will be the first since the hardline Israeli leader was elected in May.</p>
<p>It will follow a series of visits to Paris by other Middle East players, including Netanyahu's own foreign minister, David Levy, on September 10, officials said.</p>
<p>No date was given for Netanyahu's visit, which was disclosed as Chirac met visiting Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Shara.</p>
<p>Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa will be in Paris on Wednesday and U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher is due on Thursday for talks also expected to centre on the Middle East.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Herve de Charette spoke by telephone last week to both Levy and Moussa to express French unease at what Paris says are threats to the Middle East peace process.</p>
<p>France believes the slowdown in peace efforts is largely attributable to the policies of Israel's new right-wing cabinet but has soft-pedalled criticism, presumably to keep channels of communication open to both sides.</p>
<p>Chirac, who wants France to play an increasing diplomatic role in the region, is expected to tour Israel, Lebanon, the Palestinian territories and Syria next month.</p>
