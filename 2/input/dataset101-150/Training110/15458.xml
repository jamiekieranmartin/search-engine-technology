<p>PLO officials said on Monday Israel had no right to demand closure of three Palestinian offices in Arab East Jerusalem but it had shut two to deprive Israel's prime minister of any excuse to slow peace moves.</p>
<p>They rejected Israel's charge the offices were carrying out activities of the Palestinian Authority, which according to an interim peace accord is restricted to working in self-rule enclaves set up under the deal in Gaza and the West Bank.</p>
<p>&quot;When these offices, which they claim are Palestinian Authority offices, are closed, we will strip Israel of any false excuses to continue freezing the peace process,&quot; one official of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) said.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect Israel now to reopen talks and to fulfil its commitments,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The offices closed were the Maps and Survey Department and the Sports and Youth Office. The head of a third institution Israel had demanded be closed, a vocational school, is continuing to refuse to close his organisation.</p>
<p>On Sunday, a spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his office had received information on the closures and was watching the issue but declined further comment.</p>
<p>Netanyahu has linked closure of the three offices to implementation of an agreement signed by the previous government to redeploy Israeli troops in the West Bank town of Hebron.</p>
<p>Palestinians view the Hebron withdrawal as a litmus test of Netanyahu's intentions on Middle East peace moves and reject renegotiation of the deal.</p>
<p>Palestinians have argued that their institutions in Jerusalem are PLO offices predating the peace deals which created the self-rule Authority and are unconnected to self-rule governmental activities.</p>
<p>Israel captured East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war and later annexed it in a move unrecognised by the international community. It has declared both halves of the city its eternal capital.</p>
<p>Palestinians view East Jerusalem as the capital of a future state. The city's fate is up for negotiation at final peace talks which have yet to resume under Netanyahu.</p>
