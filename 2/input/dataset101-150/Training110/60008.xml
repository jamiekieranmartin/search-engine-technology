<p>Israel on Tuesday demolished the second storey of a Palestinian home in Jerusalem's Old City which it said had been built illegally, police and witnesses said.</p>
<p>A Jerusalem police spokesman said the demolition, carried out by municipal employees under heavy police guard, was in progress on Tuesday morning. Municipal officials were not immediately available to comment.</p>
<p>Witnesses said workmen wielding jackhammers were punching through walls of the second storey of the home owned by a Palestinian family located on the edge of the Old City's Armenian quarter.</p>
<p>Faisal al-Husseini, the leading Palestine Liberation Organisation official in Jerusalem, told Reuters Israel was trying to drive the Palestinians from the city holy to Moslems, Christians and Jews.</p>
<p>&quot;Actually, what they are trying to do is weaken the Palestinian presence in Jerusalem,&quot; Husseini said.</p>
<p>On August 27, Israel enraged Palestinians by demolishing a building in the Old City intended to be a Palestinian community centre it said had been funded by the Palestinian self-rule Authority.</p>
<p>Israel says under interim peace deals the Palestinian Authority is restricted to operating only in areas of the West Bank and Gaza Strip handed to them by Israel.</p>
<p>A Palestinian human rights group said on Saturday Israel had told 12 Arab families in the West Bank village of Sur Baher on the outskirts of Jerusalem that their homes would be demolished because they were built without permits.</p>
<p>Israel captured Arab East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed it. Palestinians want East Jerusalem to be the capital of a future state. Israel vows never to cede any part of the city it calls its eternal, united capital.</p>
<p>The issue is to be negotiated at final status peace talks which have yet to resume under Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who ousted the previous centre-left government in May elections.</p>
