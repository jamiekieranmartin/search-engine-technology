<p>King Hussein of Jordan on Sunday held talks on the Middle East peace process with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's political adviser Dore Gold, officials said.</p>
<p>They said the two men met at the king's palace to discuss stalled PLO-Israeli talks over Palestinian self-rule, and Israeli settlement expansion in the West Bank.</p>
<p>&quot;The issue of settlements is of great concern to us,&quot; a Jordanian government official said, adding the agenda also covered bilateral issues stemming from the 1994 Jordan-Israeli peace treaty, including implementation of a trade accord.</p>
<p>Jordan says the level of trade, particularly between Jordan and the West Bank, remains well below levels anticipated in the agreement.</p>
<p>Palace officials declined to comment on the talks.</p>
<p>Senior Palestinan officials warned Israel on Saturday that its expansion of Jewish settlements in West Bank lands occupied in the 1967 Middle East War was leading Jews and Arabs towards &quot;confrontation and disaster.&quot;</p>
<p>Netanyahu's office said the king sent a helicopter to pick up Gold. The Israeli embassy in Amman said later that Gold returned to Jerusalem accompanied by Israel's ambassador to Jordan before the start of the Jewish holy day Yom Kippur at sunset.</p>
<p>Israel's late prime minister Yitzhak Rabin in 1994 signed a peace treaty with Jordan, which of all of Israel's Arab peace partners has maintained the closest relations with Netanyahu's right-wing government since its election in May.</p>
