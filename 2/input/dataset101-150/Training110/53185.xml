<p>Lebanese Foreign Minister Faris Bouez has described a warning by Israel's proxy militia of a big Israeli military operation as blackmail aimed at forcing Lebanon to accept the Jewish state's peace proposal.</p>
<p>Bouez said in remarks published by Syria's official press on Friday that the warning, made by South Lebanon Army (SLA) commander Antoine Lahd, came up during talks he had on Thursday with Syrian president Hafez al-Assad.</p>
<p>On Friday Israeli helicopters fired rockets at suspected Hizbollah bases in south Lebanon after a clash with guerrillas from the pro-Iranian group inside Israel's occupation zone.</p>
<p>&quot;We reject this blackmail and threats which are aimed at dragging Lebanon to accept vague Israeli proposals,&quot; Bouez was quoted as saying in the al-Baath and al-Thawra newspapers.</p>
<p>Lahd delivered the warning on Wednesday while urging Lebanon to accept Israel's &quot;Lebanon first&quot; proposal for a conditional withdrawal of the Jewish state's troops from south Lebanon.</p>
<p>He said Lebanon faced the possibility of widescale Israeli retaliation if Hizbollah (Party of God) guerrillas stepped up their attacks on Israeli troops occupying a 15-km (nine-mile) south Lebanon border strip.</p>
<p>Israel said in July it would be ready to withdraw if Syrian troops also left Lebanon and if the Lebanese army could guarantee Israel's security against guerrilla attacks.</p>
<p>Israeli officials described the plan as a first step towards peace with Syria whose 35,000 troops in Lebanon give Damascus wide influence over Beirut.</p>
<p>Damascus has also rejected the proposal, saying any deal must include an Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights which Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war.</p>
<p>The fate of the Golan has been the main stumbling block in five years of sporadic Syrian-Israeli peace talks.</p>
<p>Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Shara, who participated in the Lebanese leader's meeting with Assad, said Israel was provoking a war by dragging its feet in the peace process.</p>
<p>Asked about Syrian troop movements in Lebanon, Shara said:</p>
<p>&quot;Whether there was a redeployment or not this is a Syrian-Lebanese affair. Israel has nothing to do with it at all.&quot;</p>
<p>Witnesses in Beirut said on Thursday that Syrian troops had pulled out in the past few days from several landmark positions they have occupied for years in and around the Lebanese capital.</p>
