<title>ISRAEL: Israel bans Palestinians from West Bank road.</title>

<p>A Palestinian official said on Sunday Israel had banned Palestinians from using a new bypass road built in the West Bank.</p>
<p>Mustafa al-Natshe, mayor of the West Bank city of Hebron, said Israeli soldiers prevented him and other Palestinians from using a new road that links Jerusalem to Jewish settlements located between the Palestinian cities of Bethlehem and Hebron.</p>
<p>Natshe told Reuters he was turned back last week when he tried driving on the bypass road to Jerusalem. He said soldiers told him &quot;only Jews use this road&quot;.</p>
<p>Israel confiscated vast tracts of Arab land to construct the bypass road that circumvents Hebron and PLO-ruled Bethlehem.</p>
<p>&quot;It is oppression and injustice when Israel confiscates Palestinian land and builds on it settlements and bypass roads for Jews,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a very serious matter at a time when we should be having peace with Israel because it never happened in the history of occupation.&quot;</p>
<p>An Israeli army spokeswoman said in response that &quot;the Palestinian  population has available to it acceptable (alternative) roads with passage points, through which Palestinians with permits to enter Israel may pass.&quot;</p>
<p>Under the PLO-Israel peace deal, the fate of settlements on Palestinian land was to be determined in talks on final status of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The talks have yet to resume under Israel's new government, set up in June.</p>
<p>PLO officials say construction of bypass roads in the West Bank violates the Israel-PLO agreement.</p>
