<title>LEBANON: Israeli warplanes rocket south Lebanon.</title>
<headline>Israeli warplanes rocket south Lebanon.</headline>
<dateline>NABATIYEH, Lebanon 1996-09-25</dateline>

<p>Israeli warplanes on Wednesday rocketed suspected Hizbollah guerrilla targets in south Lebanon's highlands, Lebanese security sources said.</p>
<p>Jets fired four rockets into the Iqlim al-Toufah mountain ridge from which the pro-Iranian Hizbollah (Party of God) launches guerrilla raids on Israeli troops in a south Lebanon occupation zone, the sources said.</p>
<p>The raid followed two separate attacks by Moslem guerrillas in south Lebanon on Tuesday in which four fighters of the pro-Israeli South Lebanon Army (SLA) militia were wounded.</p>
<p>It was not immediately known if there were any casualties in the air raid, the third on Lebanon in less than a week.</p>
<p>The warplanes struck as representatives of five nations monitoring a U.S.-sponsored April 26 ceasefire understanding between Lebanon and Israel met at the headquarters of U.N. peacekeeping troops in the southern village of Naqoura.</p>
<p>The ceasefire understanding bars attacks launched at or from civilian areas.</p>
<p>Delegates of France, Lebanon, Israel, Syria and the United States met to discuss Lebanese and Israeli complaints about clashes last week between Hizbollah and Israeli troops.</p>
<p>Lebanon called the meeting to protest about Israeli shelling of civilian areas last Thursday after Hizbollah killed two Israeli soldiers and wounded eight in the 15-km (nine miles)-wide occupation zone.</p>
<p>A Lebanese civilian woman was wounded in the Israeli bombardment.</p>
<p>Israel countered at a meeting of the committee on Tuesday with a complaint that Hizbollah fired at its troops from south Lebanon villages.</p>
