<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu embarks on his first European diplomatic tour on Tuesday, seeking statements of support from Britain, France and Germany.</p>
<p>Since taking office in June, Netanyahu has made two visits to Israel's main ally, the United States, eliciting statements from President Bill Clinton that his right-wing government seeks to bolster peace with the Palestinians.</p>
<p>Now he thinks it is Europe's turn.</p>
<p>&quot;Europe can play an important political role in the Middle East, for example, by confirming and affirming the principle...that we are moving and we all should move forward to peace,&quot; Netanyahu told reporters at a briefing last week.</p>
<p>In Germany last week, Palestinian President Yasser Arafat called for pressure on Netanyahu to honour Middle East peace deals signed by the previous Labour-led Israeli government.</p>
<p>&quot;Frustration and desperation are quickly increasing,&quot; Arafat said. &quot;This drags the region back to extremism, violence and terrorism. Enmity and war are appearing on the horizon.&quot;</p>
<p>Netanyahu opposes trading occupied Arab land for peace, the foundation of Middle East peace efforts launched at a conference in Madrid in 1991.</p>
<p>Citing security concerns, he has yet to carry out a long-delayed Israeli troop redeployment in the West Bank town of Hebron and has maintained a closure that bars most Palestinians from entering Israel.</p>
<p>But earlier this month Netanyahu held his first summit with Arafat, signalling acceptance of the Palestinian leader as a negotiating partner and helping to ensure a cordial welcome in world capitals.</p>
<p>Netanyahu kicks off his three-day tour in London, where he will meet Prime Minister John Major, opposition Labour party chief Tony Blair and former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.</p>
<p>He flies to Paris on Wednesday for talks with President Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Alain Juppe before travelling to Bonn on Thursday to meet Chancellor Helmut Kohl.</p>
<p>Of the countries on Netanyahu's itinerary, France has the most high-profile role in Middle East diplomacy.</p>
<p>It participates, along with the United States, Syria, Israel and Lebanon, on a committee monitoring an accord that ended an Israeli military blitz in south Lebanon in April. Chirac is to visit the Middle East in late October.</p>
<p>Netanyahu's trip sidesteps a main Israeli diplomatic problem with the European Union -- a long-running dispute over whether foreign ministers should visit PLO headquarters in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The prime minister will not be visiting Ireland, the Netherlands or Italy, whose &quot;troika&quot; of EU ministers had wanted to go to Orient House, a symbol of the PLO's desire to make East Jerusalem the capital of a future Palestinian state.</p>
<p>&quot;The Palestinian side signed a solemn pledge not to have any government activity of the PA (Palestinian self-rule Authority) institutions in Jerusalem,&quot; Netanyahu said last week.</p>
<p>&quot;I would find it astonishing that Europe would try to be more Palestinian than the Palestinians&quot; by sending ministers to Orient House,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Israel captured East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war and regards all the city as its capital, a claim that has failed to win international recognition.</p>
