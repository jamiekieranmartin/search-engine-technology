<title>ISRAEL: Palestinians close two Jerusalem offices - report.</title>
<headline>Palestinians close two Jerusalem offices - report.</headline>

<p>The Palestinian Authority has closed two offices in Arab East Jerusalem whose activities Israel charged were in violation of its peace deals with the PLO, Israel Radio said on Sunday.</p>
<p>The radio said the self-rule administration, which has no official role in the holy city, shut down the Geographic and Measurements Office and the Sports and Youth Office.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his office had received information on the closures and was watching the issue but declined further comment.</p>
<p>Senior Palestine Liberation Organisation official Mahmoud Abbas declined to confirm or deny the report.</p>
<p>Netanyahu has said Palestinian Authority operations in Jerusalem violate interim peace deals restricting such activities to self-rule areas in the West Bank and Gaza.</p>
<p>He has linked closure of the Jerusalem offices to implementation of an agreement signed by the previous government to redeploy Israeli troops in the West Bank town of Hebron.</p>
<p>Palestinians view the Hebron withdrawal as a litmus test of Netanyahu's intentions on Middle East peace moves and reject renogatiation of the deal.</p>
<p>Israel delayed its redeployment from Hebron, originally scheduled for March, after a spate of Moslem suicide bombings killed 59 people in Israel in February and March.</p>
<p>Palestinians have argued that their institutions in Jerusalem are PLO offices predating the peace deals which created the Palestinian self-rule Authority (PA) and are unconnected to self-rule governmental activities.</p>
<p>&quot;The offices in Jerusalem that are operational are not PA offices. All offices that were functioning before 1993 will continue operating and the PA has no offices in East Jerusalem,&quot; said Saeb Erekat, Palestinian local government minister.</p>
<p>The dovish Labour party government Netanyahu ousted in May elections also said PLO offices in Jerusalem violated peace deals but in effect turned a blind eye to their activities.</p>
<p>Israel captured Arab East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war and later annexed it in a move unrecognized by the international community. It has declared both halves of the city its eternal capital.</p>
<p>Palestinians view East Jerusalem as the capital of a future state. The city's fate is up for negotiation at final peace talks which have yet to resume under Netanyahu.</p>
