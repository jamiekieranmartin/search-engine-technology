<p>King Hussein of Jordan will leave for Washington on Monday for a summit aimed at salvaging Middle East peace following bloody Arab-Israeli clashes, a government official said on Sunday.</p>
<p>U.S. President Bill Clinton said he called Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and King Hussein to Washington early this week.</p>
<p>The Jordanian official earlier said the summit was planned for Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;God willing, his Majesty will leave for the United States on Monday to try and help efforts aimed at ending the violence and to revive peace talks on all tracks,&quot; the official, who requested anonymity, told Reuters. &quot;The whole peace process and region is in real danger&quot;.</p>
<p>A total of 55 Palestinians and 14 Israeli soldiers have been killed in protests sparked by Israel's opening of a tunnel in Jerusalem near al-Aqsa mosque, Islam's third holiest site.</p>
<p>King Hussein, whose country has been custodian of Moslem sites in Arab East Jerusalem since 1950, wants Israel to close the tunnel and resume peace negotiations to strengthen his own controversial 1994 treaty with Israel.</p>
<p>Jordan has a population largely of Palestinian origin but has become Israel's closest friend in the Arab world since making peace.</p>
<p>The election of Israel's hardline Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in May slammed the breaks on peace talks with Palestinians, Syria and Lebanon. His harsh treatment of Palestinans has embarrassed Jordan.</p>
<p>The kingdom ruled the West Bank and Arab Jerusalem from 1950 until losing it to Israel in the 1967 War. But it continues to pay for the upkeep of shrines, its clerics, restoration work and runs Sharia courts in Arab Jerusalem -- long a thorny issue in Jordanian-Palestinian ties.</p>
<p>Jordan's treaty with Israel recognised Amman's &quot;special role&quot; in Moslem shrines in Arab East Jerusalem. Palestinians, who hope the area will be the capital of their future state -- an idea rejected by Israel -- were angered by mention of Jordan's role.</p>
<p>King Hussein repeated on Saturday that Jordan will care for the sites until the status of Arab Jerusalem is decided to avoid a legal vacuum that Israel could use to control the shrines.</p>
<p>Permanent status talks, the final stage of the 1993 self-rule accord between Israel and the PLO, began in May but never resumed after the election of Netanyahu.</p>
<p>The king, 60, told a council of ministers meeting late on Saturday that the Palestinians had not made their stand clear on the holy city and Jordan's role. He said Israel had used the sovereignty gap to reopen the tunnel and he had been unaware of Israel's latest plans.</p>
<p>&quot;Regarding Jerusalem and what happened, I think that it explains and justifies our position demanding that the issue of sovereignty should have no role in the Holy City,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Jordan has long maintained it will give responsibility for the holy sites to the Palestinians once the permanent status of the city is settled.</p>
