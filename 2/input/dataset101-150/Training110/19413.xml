<p>President Yasser Arafat said on Wednesday Israel's policy on settlements and Jerusalem amounted to a declaration of war on the Palestinians and called the first general strike in the West Bank and Gaza in two years.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, responding to Arafat's strongest attack on his right-wing government since its election in May, said Israel would view as &quot;very grave&quot; any attempt to step up tensions or violence.</p>
<p>Arafat lashed out during a session of the Palestinian legislature against Israel's new policy of Jewish settlement expansion and its uncompromising line on Jerusalem.</p>
<p>&quot;What happened concerning continuous violations and crimes from this new Israeli leadership means they are declaring a state of war against the Palestinian people,&quot; Arafat said.</p>
<p>In his speech to the crowded legislature, he signalled he was not abandoning diplomacy although &quot;alarm bells are ringing&quot;.</p>
<p>His tough talk was sparked by Israel's announcement on Tuesday of plans to expand the settlement of Kiryat Sefer and its demolition of a community centre in Arab East Jerusalem which Israeli authorities said was built without a permit.</p>
<p>&quot;Israel has started the war on Jerusalem. They are idiots to have started the Jerusalem battle,&quot; Arafat said in Arabic.</p>
<p>&quot;There will be no Palestinian state without Jerusalem. Netanyahu should know he is stupid to have started this battle.&quot;</p>
<p>Arafat called a half-day general strike &quot;for Jerusalem&quot; on Thursday in all of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. It will be the first strike in both areas since Israel handed over parts of the West Bank and Gaza to Palestinian self-rule in 1994.</p>
<p>&quot;I would avoid inflammatory rhetoric of this kind. I think it would be a very grave mistake to have an escalation of both rhetoric or of deeds especially an escalation toward violence,&quot; Netanyahu told reporters during a tour in central Israel.</p>
<p>&quot;We are in the process of concluding a framework for moving ahead and negotiating many of the outstanding issues between Israel and the Palestinians, something that I would like to do and I hope that this kind of escalation does not hinder (it),&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Arafat also called on Palestinians to flock to East Jerusalem for Moslem Friday prayers.</p>
<p>Many Palestinians will not be able to respond to Arafat's call. Israeli travel restrictions, imposed after bombings by Moslem militants in February and March, ban most of the two million Arabs in the West Bank and Gaza from entering Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Israel captured East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war and claims both halves of the city as its capital. The PLO wants East Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state.</p>
<p>Arafat told the council before it recessed that his senior negotiator Mahmoud Abbas would meet Netanyahu's adviser Dore Gold on Thursday but when the council reconvened PLO officials said the meeting would not be held.</p>
<p>&quot;The meeting tomorrow will not take place,&quot; said Abbas's deputy Hassan Asfour.</p>
<p>&quot;Council members are exerting tremendous pressure on the political leadership and on President Arafat not to carry out any meeting with Israelis unless Israel ceases immediately its activities and starts genuine negotiations,&quot; said Hanan Ashrawi, a member of Arafat's cabinet.</p>
<p>Palestinians have been pressing Israel to carry out a long-delayed partial troop pullout from the flashpoint West Bank city of Hebron agreed by the previous Labour government.</p>
<p>The Israeli government is studying redeployment plans submitted by Defence Minister Yitzhak Mordechai which are likely to demand a wider-than-agreed army presence in Hebron.</p>
