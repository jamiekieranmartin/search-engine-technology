<p>Foreign currency trading in Israel opened in a nervous and volatile atmosphere on Monday against a background of political uncertainty and a stronger dollar worldwide.</p>
<p>In the first hour of trading, the U.S. currency rose to 3.2285 shekels from Friday's representative rate of 3.1927. It then fell back to as low as 3.2075. The basket of foreign currencies rose to as high as 3.6050 shekels, before falling as low as 3.5809.</p>
<p>It was a &quot;a very hectic morning,&quot;  said a trader at Bank Leumi.  &quot;We saw a lot of demand early this morning,&quot; he said. &quot;But they soon sold.&quot;  He described trading volume as well above the average of the last two months.</p>
<p>The trader attributed the volatility to the strengthening of the dollar on world markets since late Thursday as well as to concerns about the violent clashes between Israeli troops and Palestinians last week.</p>
<p>The violence has since subsided and key Middle East leaders are due to meet this week in Washington for a summit aimed at resolving the issues that led to the clashes. Nevertheless, Israeli financial markets remained concerned about the damage it may have done to the Middle East peace process.</p>
