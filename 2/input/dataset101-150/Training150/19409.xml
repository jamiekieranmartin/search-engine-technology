<p>Gunmen shot and wounded two people on Wednesday when they fired at an Israeli bus travelling near a Jewish settlement in the West Bank, a police officer said.</p>
<p>Some 15 shots were fired at a commuter bus making its way to the Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba near Hebron, police officer Boaz Goldberg told Israel Radio.</p>
<p>The radio said the bus was reinforced and that the two people had been injured from glass fragments. It was reported that a third person suffered a heart attack.</p>
<p>&quot;While we were driving to Kiryat Arba we suddenly heard a lot of shooting toward the bus. We jumped to the floor,&quot; a witness told a Reuters cameraman.</p>
<p>The attack took place on a road, south of Bethlehem, which Israel built specifically to bypass Palestinian areas. Police set up roadblocks in the area and were conducting a large manhunt for the attackers.</p>
<p>Israel army radio said it was unclear whether the shots were fired from a passing vehicle or in an ambush.</p>
<p>No one has claimed responsibility for the shooting.</p>
<p>Arab gunmen in July shot and killed three Israelis in a drive-by attack inside Israel.</p>
<p>Israel sealed off the West Bank and Gaza Strip following a spate of Islamic militant suicide bombings that killed 59 people in Israel in February and March.</p>
