<p>President Yasser Arafat on Wednesday called Israel's policy on Jerusalem and settlements a declaration of war on the Palestinians and called the first general strike in the West Bank and Gaza in two years.</p>
<p>The Palestinian Legislative Council demanded a halt to contacts with Israel until the Jewish state honoured its peace pledges. A resolution released by the council called for &quot;halting contacts with the Israeli side&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;What happened concerning continuous violations and crimes from this new Israeli leadership means they are declaring a state of war against the Palestinian people,&quot; Arafat said.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, responding to Arafat's strongest attack on his right-wing government since its election in May, said Israel would view as &quot;very grave&quot; any attempt to step up tensions or violence.</p>
<p>Hours after Arafat's statement two people were wounded in a shooting incident at an Israeli bus in the West Bank in what some Israeli commentators said may be linked to the Palestinian leader's comments.</p>
<p>Arafat lashed out during a session of the Palestinian legislature against Israel's decision to expand the Jewish settlement of Kiryat Sefer in the West Bank and its demolition of a community center in Arab East Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy telephoned Arafat after the Legislative Council meeting and explained to the Palestinian leader that the demolotion on Tuesday in Jerusalem was not politically motivated.</p>
<p>&quot;In relation to the demolition of the building in the old city the foreign minister...requested to make clear to Arafat that this was not an action on behalf of the government,&quot; a foreign ministry statement said.</p>
<p>&quot;It was an administrative action carried out by the municipality,&quot; it said. The Jerusalem Municipality has said the structure was built without the proper permits.</p>
<p>&quot;Israel has started the war on Jerusalem. They are idiots to have started the Jerusalem battle,&quot; Arafat said in Arabic. &quot;There will be no Palestinian state without Jerusalem. Netanyahu should know he is stupid to have started this battle.&quot;</p>
<p>Arafat called a half-day general strike &quot;for Jerusalem&quot; on Thursday in all of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. It will be the first strike in both areas since Israel handed over parts of them to Palestinian self-rule in 1994.</p>
<p>Arafat also called on Palestinians to flock to East Jerusalem for Moslem Friday prayers, but most will be prevented by an Israeli closure imposed on the West Bank and Gaza six months ago after a spate of suicide bombings.</p>
<p>Israel captured East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war and claims both halves of the city as its capital. The PLO wants East Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state.</p>
<p>&quot;I would avoid inflammatory rhetoric of this kind. I think it would be a very grave mistake to have an escalation of both rhetoric or of deeds, especially an escalation toward violence,&quot; Netanyahu told reporters during a tour in central Israel.</p>
<p>Some 15 shots were fired on Wednesday night at an Israeli commuter bus making its way to the Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba near Hebron, slightly wounding two people, an Israel army spokeswoman said. The incident took place near Bethlehem.</p>
<p>Palestinians have been pressing Israel to carry out a long-delayed partial troop pullout from the flashpoint West Bank city of Hebron agreed by the previous Labour government.</p>
<p>The Israeli government is studying redeployment plans submitted by Defence Minister Yitzhak Mordechai which are likely to demand an army presence in Hebron beyond what had been agreed.</p>
