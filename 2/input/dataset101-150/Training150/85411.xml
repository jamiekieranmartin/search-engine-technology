<title>USA: Noise drives New Yorkers crazy.</title>

<p>New Yorkers can't stand the noise anymore.</p>
<p>A telephone hotline set up to help police curb panhandling, prostitution and public drinking has received more complaints about the constant barrage of sound people live with than anything else.</p>
<p>The toll-free, 24-hour line opened two weeks ago as part of a campaign to stop so-called &quot;quality of life&quot; crimes, but 43 percent of the calls have been about noise from car alarms, loud music, roaring trucks, machinery and motorcycles.</p>
<p>Police said on Tuesday operators have logged 1,279 calls with 545 complaints about noise and only 79 about panhandlers and 54 each about prostitutes and drinking in public.</p>
<p>Officials have attributed the lowest crime rate in decades to their quality-of-life strategy, which is based on the belief that many people who commit minor offences go on to perpetrate major crimes.</p>
<p>In establishing the non-emergency telephone line, police asked the public to also report aggressive panhandlers, loiterers at automatic banking machines, illegal dumpers and the so-called &quot;squeegee men&quot; -- who approach stationary cars at intersections and wash windscreens with rubber implements known as squeegees in expectation of a tip.</p>
<p>For shootings, robberies and other emergencies, New Yorkers still call 911.</p>
