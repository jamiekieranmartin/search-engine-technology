<p>Seven Palestinians, two Israeli paramilitary policemen and an Israeli soldier were killed in a third day of violence in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and Jerusalem on Friday.</p>
<p>On Jerusalem's Temple Mount, site of al-Aqsa mosque, Israeli security forces shot dead three Palestinians during a stone-throwing protest, Arab hospital officials said.</p>
<p>In the West Bank, four Palestinians and two Israeli paramilitary policemen were shot dead in separate clashes as violence continued to rage, hospital officials and witnesses said. An Israeli soldier was killed in the Gaza Strip.</p>
<p>Moslem Friday prayers and Palestinian protest marches were the backdrop for the latest bloodshed.</p>
<p>On the Temple Mount, Islam's third holiest shrine, several hundred Palestinians threw stones, injuring five Israeli policemen. Israeli security forces responded with gunfire, killing the three Palestinians and wounded more than 50, the hospital officials said.</p>
<p>&quot;There was massive stone-throwing at our forces...there was no choice but to finish dealing with the demonstrators. The truth is we didn't make any use of live ammunition. Rubber bullets were used and maybe one tear gas grenade,&quot; Israeli police commissioner Assaf Hefetz told Israel Radio.</p>
<p>In the West Bank town of Tulkarm, two Israeli paramilitary policemen and a Palestinian were killed in clashes, Israel Radio and Arab hospital officials said. Fifteen Arabs were wounded.</p>
<p>Just outside Jericho, also in the West Bank, three Palestinians were shot dead by Israeli gunfire and 12 Arabs and two Israeli soldiers were wounded when demonstrators threw stones at troops, hospital officials and Israeli security sources said.</p>
<p>An Israeli soldier was killed in clashes in the town of Rafah, on Gaza's border with Egypt, Israeli security sources said.</p>
<p>Israel used combat helicopters to fire on Palestinian demonstrators in Rafah, wounding at least 20, witnesses said. The incident began when protesters took over an Israeli military outpost abandoned on Thursday night, lowering the Israeli flag and replacing it with a Palestinian one.</p>
<p>Palestinians dragged away coils of barbed wire that separate the Egyptian and Gazan halves of Rafah, the witnesses said. The crowd scattered and Egyptian soldiers on their side of the frontier took cover behind buildings as the helicopters shot into the Gazan side of Rafah.</p>
<p>Also in Gaza, two Palestinians who were shot by Israeli forces on Thursday died of their wounds on Friday, hospital sources said.</p>
<p>Arabs threw rocks at an Israeli checkpoint near the West Bank town of Ramallah, drawing Israeli gunfire. Witnesses said many of the protesters were wounded, but no exact number was available.</p>
<p>Violence also erupted in Bethlehem, where 29 Arabs were taken to hospital suffering either from gunshot wounds or tear gas inhalation.</p>
<p>In Qalqilya, also in the West Bank, 10 Palestinians were shot and wounded, witnesses said. Five Arabs suffered gunshot wounds in the Hebron area.</p>
<p>Since Wednesday, 67 people -- 53 Palestinians and 14 Israelis -- have been killed in violence touched off by Israel's opening of a tunnel near Moslem holy sites in Jerusalem.</p>
