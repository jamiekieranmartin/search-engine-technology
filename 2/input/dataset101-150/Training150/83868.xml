<p>An Israeli policeman and two Palestinians were wounded on Sunday in fresh clashes over the Jewish state's policies in Jerusalem, Israel Radio and Palestinian sources said.</p>
<p>In Jerusalem, Palestinians hurled stones at Israeli policemen at the reopening on Sunday of the controversial tourist tunnel which triggered gunbattles last week. One policeman was lightly injured in the stone-throwing, Israel Radio said.</p>
<p>Nearly 70 people, mostly Palestinians, were killed last week in clashes prompted by the tunnel's opening in Arab East Jerusalem. The tunnel, along foundations of the Temple Mount and near Islam's third holiest shrine, was closed temporarily on Friday and Saturday for the Jewish Sabbath.</p>
<p>At al-Arroub refugee camp in the West Bank near Hebron, Israeli troops shooting tear gas and rubber bullets wounded one Arab on Sunday, Palestinian sources said. They did not immediately know if the man had been shot or injured by the tear gas.</p>
<p>At the Palestinian self-rule enclave of Bethlehem, some 200 Palestinians demonstrated but PLO police prevented them from reaching an Israeli army post at the tomb of the biblical Rachel at the entrance to the enclave, Palestinian sources said.</p>
<p>There were also peaceful protest marches at the Ramallah self-rule enclave, witnesses said.</p>
<p>In the Gaza Strip, Israeli troops before dawn shot and wounded a Palestinian policeman who was patrolling a PLO police training camp on the beach near a Jewish settlement block, PLO Brigadier-General Samih Nasr told reporters.</p>
<p>The Israeli army said on Sunday that its troops killed a Palestinian on Saturday in the Gaza Strip. Palestinian security officials could not confirm the fatality, the only one reported from Saturday.</p>
<p>&quot;Yesterday morning protesters marched from Khan Younis toward an army position in the centre of the Gaza Strip. A Palestinian who was holding a grenade was shot and killed,&quot; an Israeli army spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>Palestinian police kept a lid on protests in most of the West Bank and Gaza on Saturday while U.S. and U.N. officials tried to organise a PLO-Israeli summit to prevent more violence from threatening Middle East peace. On Wednesday, Thursday and Friday Israeli and Palestinian forces fought fierce gun battles.</p>
<p>Palestinian President Yasser Arafat said in an interview published in Israel's Yedioth Ahronoth daily on Sunday that Palestinian anger would fade if the second opening to the tourist tunnel that spurred the riots were closed.</p>
<p>Palestinians call the opening punched through a wall in the Moslem Quarter of Jerusalem's Old City an attempt to Judaise Jerusalem and therefore a flagrant breach of interim peace deals. The Israeli move evoked international condemnation.</p>
