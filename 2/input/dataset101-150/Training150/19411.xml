<p>Gunmen shot and wounded two people when they fired on Wednesday at an Israeli bus travelling near a Jewish settlement in the West Bank, Israeli media reported and a medical worker said.</p>
<p>&quot;So far we have treated two people and are checking to see if there are any other victims,&quot; said Yeruham Mndola, an official of the ambulance company at the scene. He did not elaborate on the victims' condition.</p>
<p>Israel radio said the shooting on an Israeli commuter bus took place near the Neve Daniel settlement south of Bethlehem.</p>
<p>Israel army radio said it was unclear whether the shots were fired from a passing vehicle or in an ambush. It said searches were under way.</p>
<p>No one has claimed responsibility for the shooting.</p>
<p>Arab guerrillas in July shot and killed three Israelis in a drive-by attack inside Israel. Israel sealed off the West Bank and Gaza Strip following a spate of Islamic militant suicide bombings that killed 59 people in Israel in February and March.</p>
