<title>USA: Crime triggers state of emergency in Gary, Indiana.</title>
<headline>Crime triggers state of emergency in Gary, Indiana.</headline>
<dateline>GARY, Ind. 1996-09-13</dateline>
<text>
<p>City officials operating under an emergency order cracked down on violent crime in Gary Friday with beefed-up police patrols and strict curfew enforcement.</p>
<p>Police reported no major criminal activity in the 24 hours since Mayor Scott King declared a state of emergency Thursday and ordered the tightened security measures.</p>
<p>He acted after incidents earlier in the week in which a high school was hit by a drive-by shooting and a public housing project was torn apart by an apparent gang-related gun battle.</p>
<p>No one was injured in the shootings but King said he was putting more police on the streets and ordering security measures at high schools.</p>
<p>&quot;The line is drawn and it's not happening in this city any more,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Gary has one of the highest murder rates per-capita in the United States. Last year Indiana state police were sent in to try to restore order.</p>
