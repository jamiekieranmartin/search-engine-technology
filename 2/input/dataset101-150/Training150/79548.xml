<p>Fifteen Palestinians and two Israeli soldiers were killed on Thursday in gunbattles and clashes that raged across the Gaza Strip and West Bank, Palestinian medical sources and Israel Radio said.</p>
<p>At least 100 Palestinians and 23 Israelis were wounded.</p>
<p>The deaths raised to 20 the number of Palestinians killed in two days of clashes with Israeli forces over Israeli policy in Jerusalem, holy to Moslems and Jews, and the first Israeli fatalities.</p>
<p>Israel Radio said the two Israeli soldiers were killed when hundreds of Palestinians, including dozens of policemen, charged an army post near the Netzarim Jewish settlement.</p>
<p>At Rafah, a town bordering Egypt in the Gaza Strip, Israeli soldiers shot dead four protesters, among them a 14-year-old boy, when demonstrators there threw stones and ripped down part of the border fence. Two Israeli helicopters dropped teargas and percussion grenades on the demonstrators.</p>
<p>In Ramallah in the West Bank, hospital officials said Israeli troops killed three Palestinians when they fired on thousands of Palestinians stoning their position. Palestinian police then opened fire on the Israeli troops.</p>
<p>A Jewish settler spokeswoman said 23 Israelis were injured in Gaza, at least five of them soldiers. There was no immediate word of Israeli wounded in the West Bank.</p>
<p>In all, in the Gaza Strip, 12 Palestinians were killed, some in pitched battles with Israeli troops near the Jewish settlements of Kfar Darom and Netzarim, and three Palestinians were killed in Ramallah. Among the dead in Gaza were three Palestinian policemen and a 13-year-old girl, Nora Abu Saad.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, five Palestinians were killed in Ramallah.</p>
<p>Hospitals and clinics in the Gaza Strip reported more than 50 people wounded. Hospital sources in the West Bank said more than 30 Palestinians were wounded in the Bethlehem area and 30 more in Hebron. Witnesses said dozens of people were wounded in Ramallah, but there was no immediate official count.</p>
<p>Palestinian sources said that at the West Bank town of Bethlehem demonstrators battling Israeli troops at Rachel's Tomb burned a recently renovated part of the tomb.</p>
<p>Palestinian sources said in the Gaza Strip, the clashes occurred near the two Jewish settlements, at the Erez border crossing to Israel, at Rafah and other areas. In the West Bank, the fighting occurred at Ramallah, Bethlehem, Nablus and Hebron.</p>
