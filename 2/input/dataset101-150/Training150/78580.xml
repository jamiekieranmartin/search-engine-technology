<p>Israeli troops killed 33 Palestinians and PLO police shot dead 10 Israelis in gun battles and stone-throwing clashes on Thursday, the bloodiest day in the West Bank and Gaza since Yasser Arafat set up his self-rule government.</p>
<p>Israel declared a state of emergency, deploying extra troops and sending in tanks and helicopters to quell the violence. It was the first time the Jewish state had used tanks in the West Bank since it captured the territory in 1967, Israel Radio said.</p>
<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cut short a European tour and asked for a meeting with Palestinian President Arafat to put an end to the battles.</p>
<p>PLO officials said Arafat, who returned to Gaza in July 1994 to lead the Palestinian Authority, wanted Netanyahu to commit to peace deals not just discuss an end to the violence.</p>
<p>Palestinian police let off bursts of automatic rifle fire from behind concrete blocks at crouching Israeli soldiers in scenes reminiscent of Beirut militia battles.</p>
<p>Israeli helicopters fired at gunmen in apartment blocks in Ramallah, north of Jerusalem, and armoured personnel carriers tried to rescue Israelis trapped inside the Jewish shrine of Joseph's Tomb in the West Bank town of Nablus.</p>
<p>The fighting undermined U.S. hopes of keeping alive Arab-Israeli peace talks, stalled since Netanyahu brought in his right-wing government exactly 100 days ago.</p>
<p>An Arab League meeting of ambassadors in Cairo hailed what they called &quot;the intifada of the Palestinian people&quot; and said a tunnel Israel opened in Jerusalem was part of a plot to destroy a Moslem shrine.</p>
<p>It was the first time in at least three years that the Arab League had used the word intifida, which means uprising, to describe the clashes between Israelis and Palestinians.</p>
<p>The violence took the death toll to 38 Arabs and 10 Israelis in two days of clashes. More than 300 Palestinians and 43 Israelis were wounded on Thursday, medical sources said.</p>
<p>Arafat ordered his 30,000-strong paramilitary police to shoot only if fired on. Palestinian policemen tried to hold back stone-throwers in Ramallah and Nablus after the worst of the fighting had subsided, witnesses said.</p>
<p>Fighting was strongest around Jewish settlements in Gaza, at the entrance to PLO-ruled Ramallah, and at Joseph's Tomb in Nablus where security sources said about 40 soldiers and settlers were besieged by stone-throwers.</p>
<p>Israel denied its opening of an archaeological tunnel adjacent to the al-Aqsa and Dome of the Rock mosque complex, Islam's third holiest shrine after Mecca and Medina, was an assault on Moslem sites in disputed Arab East Jerusalem.</p>
<p>But the move unleashed long pent up Palestinian frustration with the self-rule agreement which Netanyahu has held up.</p>
<p>Arafat's Palestinian Authority urged Arab states to isolate and punish Israel.</p>
<p>The Palestinian delegate to the Arab League, Mohamed Sobeih, made the appeal at the one-day Arab League meeting in Cairo.</p>
<p>&quot;Palestinian land has been turned into fields of war, on which many martyrs have fallen,&quot; Sobeih said.</p>
<p>Washington, which has spent the past five years trying to build Middle East peace, worked frantically behind the scenes to stop the fighting.</p>
<p>&quot;We are trying as hard as we can, the United States, to stop the violence and get the two sides back talking about their problems&quot; U.S. Consul General in Jerusalem, Edward Abington said, touring the scene of the Ramallah clashes in an armoured limousine.</p>
<p>Britain voiced grave concern and French President Jacques Chirac telephoned Arafat on Thursday to express support and appeal for calm.</p>
<p>The French Foreign Ministry blamed Israel for triggering the riots and said they were a worrying throwback to the 1987-93 intifada. Then youths confronted Israeli troops with stones.</p>
<p>This week the youths urged their armed police to protect them. In Gaza, when one Palestinian policmen fell wounded, a young boy picked up his rifle and shot at Israelis.</p>
<p>Two Israeli soldiers were killed when hundreds of Palestinians charged an army post near the isolated Netzarim Jewish settlement south of Gaza City, Israel Radio said. It said two other Israelis were killed in the West Bank town of Nablus, at the tomb of the biblical Joseph.</p>
<p>Three branches of Arafat's police fired at Israeli jeeps from behind concrete blocks at a checkpoint near Kfar Darom settlement in the centre of the Gaza Strip.</p>
<p>&quot;Stop throwing stones, this will not help now,&quot; a Palestinian officer shouted. His words were drowned out by the crackle of automatic rifle fire from members of Arafat's Preventive Security force and the Coast Guard.</p>
<p>Among others killed in Gaza was a girl aged between 14 and 16 years, health officials said.</p>
<p>In Ramallah Palestinian Colonel Ribhi Arafat arrived with troops at the scene of the clashes trying to arrange a ceasefire with the Israelis, witnesses said.</p>
<p>Protests in Jerusalem, which is cut off from the West Bank by an Israeli closure, were muted. Palestinians accuse Israel of trying to Judaise Arab East Jerusalem, which they consider to be illegally occupied by the Jewish state.</p>
<p>Israeli Defence Minister Yizhak Mordechai questioned the decision to open the tunnel. &quot;I don't know whether to say with finality that...all considerations were taken into account,&quot; he told reporters.</p>
<p>Israeli shares fell sharply across the board in reaction to the violence. The benchmark Mishtanim index of the top 100 shares fell 4.04 percent.</p>
