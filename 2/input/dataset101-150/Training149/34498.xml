<title>ARGENTINA: Argentine Congress passes revenue-boosting laws.</title>

<p>Argentina's lower house of Congress approved and passed on to the Senate Thursday a law reducing family allowance benefits and imposing a 14 percent tax to employers on widely-used food vouchers.</p>
<p>The government initiative launched in July by former Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo was approved in the Chamber of Deputies before dawn after a long debate, with substantial modifications to the original project.</p>
<p>Under the legislation, family allowance benefits would be scrapped for those earning above $1,500 a month, except for those who have handicapped children.  </p>
<p>Workers earning up to $500 would get $40 in family allowances, those making up to $1,000 would get $30 and those earning up to $1,500 would receive $20.  While the higher-income earners would lose their benefits under the bill, the lowest earners would receive more.</p>
<p>The president of the Social Program Committee in the Chamber of Deputies, Oraldo Britos, defended the law saying &quot;it will benefit 90 percent of workers.&quot;</p>
<p>The other law passed by the Chamber of Deputies early Thursday is one imposing a levy on widely-used food vouchers that employers give workers as part of their pay packages.  </p>
<p>Employers would now have to pay a 14 percent tax on the so-called luncheon tickets.  The ruling Peronist Party wanted to apply a tax of only 10 percent on the tickets but caved in to pressure from the government, which needs the extra income.</p>
<p>The original project designed by Cavallo sought to cap family allowances at $1,000 and wanted to impose higher taxes on the food vouchers.</p>
<p>The measures, designed to boost revenue and savings to reduce a growing fiscal deficit, sparked widespread condemnation and provoked a general strike in August.</p>
<p>A few weeks after announcing the measures, Cavallo and President Carlos Menem had a row which resulted in the minister's dismissal.</p>
