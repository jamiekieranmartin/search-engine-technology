<p>Israeli police hoisted a bulldozer over the walls of Jerusalem's Old City at dawn on Tuesday and destroyed an Arab building, reigniting the battle for land between Arab and Jew.</p>
<p>Palestinians called a two-hour general strike and marched in protest against the demolition of the incomplete building which the Jerusalem Municipality said was being constructed without a permit.</p>
<p>&quot;This building was intended to serve Palestinians in the Old City and posed no threat to the Israelis,&quot; Palestinian Legislative Council member Ahmed Hashem Zighayer told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a war that has been declared on us and we want our people to come and see the site where they declared the war,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Arab residents said a crane lifted a bulldozer over the city walls when most people were still asleep. The bulldozer, which could not have entered through the city's gates, flattened the building which was intended as a centre for the handicapped.</p>
<p>Palestinian lawmakers said the demolition was the latest sign of a tougher Israeli policy towards the city's 165,000 Arabs since the right-wing government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu won office in May.</p>
<p>&quot;It is clear that the policy of the Likud government is to kill the peace process. The demolition of this building today is but an example of this policy,&quot; Palestinian Legislative Council member Ahmed al-Batsh said at the scene.</p>
<p>Palestinian legislators Hanan Ashrawi and Ahmed Korei led a march of about 100 people from the demolition site.</p>
<p>Korei, better known as Abu Alaa, said Palestinians wanted to know: &quot;if this is peace or a cover for continuing the occupation...This is peace by a bulldozer and by a tank.&quot;</p>
<p>The demolition came a day after PLO officials said they had bowed to Netanyahu's demand to close their offices in Jerusalem. Netanyahu made the closure of the three offices a condition for resuming peace negotiations with the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO).</p>
<p>Palestinians accuse Netanyahu of delaying the implementation of the self-rule accord with Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority in order to secure better terms on sensitive issues such the Jewish presence in Hebron and East Jerusalem.</p>
<p>&quot;The building destroyed in the Old City was unoccupied. It was destroyed because it was built without a permit just as all buildings built without a permit are,&quot; a Municipality spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>Israeli police said the building was funded by the Palestinian Authority for use as a social club.</p>
<p>Hayel Sandouka, president of the al-Laqlaq Tower Centre, a charitable organisation helping Palestinians in the Old City, denied this. He said building was funded by private charities including organisations from Canada and Sweden.</p>
<p>He said the the 150 square metre (1,600 square feet) building was part of a large project that would include a handicapped centre, a home for the elderly and a kindergarten.</p>
<p>Palestinians said they feared the demolition was part of an attempt to seize a large plot of land owned by the charity.</p>
<p>Palestinians say Israel is trying to settle Jews inside the predominantly Arab Old City to tighten its grip the area which contains sites holy to Jews, Moslems and Christians.</p>
<p>Palestinians regard East Jerusalem as the capital of a future state. The fate of Jerusalem is up for negotiation during talks on the final status of the Arab territories Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war.</p>
