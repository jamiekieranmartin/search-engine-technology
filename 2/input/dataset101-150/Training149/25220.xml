<p>Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt, in his first news conference after a 10-week bout with malaria, said on Friday the German economy is also back on its feet.</p>
<p>Repeating earlier estimates, Rexrodt said gross domestic product (GDP) grew around one percent in the second quarter of 1996 from the same quarter a year ago.</p>
<p>&quot;The German economy is regaining its footing,&quot; he said, standing by the government's April forecast of 0.75 percent economic growth for 1996 and 2.0 to 2.5 percent in 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;This figure is secure on the downside. It will not be less,&quot; Rexrodt said, referring to the projected 1996 growth. &quot;Although no official data are yet available ... the upward development is increasingly confirmed by the facts at hand.&quot;</p>
<p>The labour market remains in the doldrums, however. Rexrodt said even with the higher economic growth forecast for next year, a drop in unemployment depends on a greater readiness of companies to invest.</p>
<p>&quot;Investment funds are on hand, but action depends on the signals people get from government savings measures,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Programme for More Jobs and Growth, aimed at cutting government spending and easing corporations' regulatory burdens to encourage investment, is making its way through parliament, and most of the package should be enacted by mid-September.</p>
<p>&quot;These (measures) are painful and unpopular, but they are unavoidable if growth and employment are to rise,&quot; he said. The package has met stiff resistance from unions and opposition Social Democrats, who say austerity will aggravate joblessness.</p>
<p>Rexrodt said the economy is getting back into swing following an unusually severe winter, which hit the construction sector especially hard.</p>
<p>Growth in the second quarter was substantial when measured from the previous quarter's output, when GDP shrank 0.4 percent from the previous quarter, he said.</p>
<p>The government is due to announce data on second quarter gross domestic product on September 5.</p>
<p>Rexrodt said he expected the economy to continue to expand moderately in the second half of the year, fueled by exports and reviving capital investment.</p>
<p>Exports are also rebounding thanks to economic growth for key trading partners, gentler rises in unit-labour costs, and a retreat in last year's overvaluation of the mark.</p>
<p>The mark's current level is still not ideal, but most German companies can live with it, he said.</p>
<p>Domestic industrial orders are rebounding as companies plan incremental increases in investment for this year. Capacity utilisation stopped declining in the second quarter.</p>
<p>Business confidence is rising, according to the Ifo survey, while inflation remains subdued.</p>
<p>East German manufacturing is on the mend, but high unit-labour costs remain a major handicap, he said.</p>
