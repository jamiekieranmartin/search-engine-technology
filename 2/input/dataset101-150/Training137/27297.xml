<p>Hong Kong conservationists were left horrified when a passerby took the eggs laid by the endangered Green Turtle after the reptile returned to the water, an official said on Monday.</p>
<p>Green Turtles used to nest on one of Hong Kong's offshore islands until pollution and increasing numbers of people drove them away.</p>
<p>So when word spread over the weekend that a rare Green turtle had been spotted for the first time in many years laying eggs on the beach on the southern side of Lamma Island, conservationists were delighted.</p>
<p>But their delight soon turned fury when they realised the eggs had been pinched by the passerby, said Frazer McGilvray, spokesman for the Hong Kong Marine Conservation Society.</p>
<p>The collecter gave the protected eggs away his friends as presents, he added.</p>
<p>It is a criminal offence to take turtle eggs in Hong Kong. But it was not immediately known whether the passerby, whose identity was not divulged, would be charged.</p>
