<p>Hong Kong's most senior official on Friday urged demonstrators challenging Japan's control of a small group of islands in the East China Sea not to jeopardise the territory's relations with Tokyo.</p>
<p>Ending a week-long visit to Australia, Chief Secretary Anson Chan said she was saddened by the death of Hong Kong activist David Chan during a protest action in waters around the islands, but she urged calm in the aftermath of the tragedy.</p>
<p>&quot;I understand the depth of feeling but I hope that views will be expressed in a calm manner without affecting the relationship between ourselves and Japan,&quot; she said. Her remarks from Melbourne were broadcast on Hong Kong radio.</p>
<p>Thousands of Hong Kong people are expected to join a candlelight vigil in a central city park on Sunday night to commemorate Chan's death.</p>
<p>The Chief Secretary, second-in-command to Hong Kong's colonial Governor Chris Patten, said the dispute over the islands, referred to in Chinese as the Diaoyus and in Japanese as the Senkakus, needed to be settled peacefully.</p>
<p>Activist David Chan, leader of 18 protesters who were aboard the ship Kien Hwa 2, drowned on Thursday after leaping into stormy seas in defiance of a blockade of the disputed islands by Japanese coastguard vessels.</p>
<p>His death was the first in almost two months of protests by Chinese communities in Hong Kong, China, Taiwan and Macau since Japanese rightwingers built a lighthouse and raised Japanese flags on the islands.</p>
