<headline>Taiwan mourns activist's death, blames governments.</headline>

<p>Taiwan media on Friday mourned the death of Hong Kong activist David Chan in the latest protest against Japan's claim to an uninhabited cluster of East China Sea islands, blaming Taipei and Beijing for failing to help.</p>
<p>&quot;Frenetic Hong Kong, embarrassed Beijing and indifferent Taipei,&quot; the mass-circulation United Daily News newspaper said.</p>
<p>&quot;How sarcastic that it was Japanese planes and ships helping the protesters,&quot; the newspaper said in a commentary.</p>
<p>Chan's group sailed out of Hong Kong on Sunday intending to tear down Japanese flags and a lighthouse built by Japanese ultranationalists on one of the disputed islands, known as the Diaoyus in Chinese and the Senkakus in Japanese.</p>
<p>The rusty Kien Hwa 2 ended its mission in tragedy when protest leader David Chan, 45, and four other protesters jumped into the storm-whipped sea on Thursday, vowing to defy Japan's claim to the Diaoyus.</p>
<p>A Japanese doctor later declared Chan dead and another injured protester was flown to Okinawa in southern Japan by a Japanese helicopter.</p>
<p>Three others were plucked from the sea unhurt.</p>
<p>&quot;Recent Protect-the-Diaoyu movements are motivated by the people in Taiwan, Hong Kong and China. The governments (in Taipei and Beijing) are only forced to declare their positons,&quot; said another major Taiwan newspaper, the China Times.</p>
<p>&quot;To calm down passions over the Diaoyus, both governments should adopt a more active attitude.&quot;</p>
<p>Chan's death was the first in a wave of protests to sweep Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau and China since July, when Japanese right-wingers built a lighthouse and raised Japan's flag on the islands northeast of Taiwan to assert Tokyo's sovereignty.</p>
<p>Japan, saying there is no dispute to discuss, has claimed the islands since 1895. China and Taiwan, separated by a civil war in 1949, say the islands have been Chinese territory for centuries.</p>
<p>China, keen to marshal patriotism stirred by the sovereignty row without offending Japanese investors, reiterated its call for Tokyo to restrain right-wing activists whose actions have whipped up Chinese nationalism against Japan.</p>
<p>The Taiwan government repeatedly called for calm in the simmering dispute, saying it planned to hold talks with Japan on fishery issues near the Diaoyus.</p>
<p>Hong Kong, a British colony for more than 150 years, reverts to Chinese rule in mid-1997 and many Hong Kong people see the dispute as a test of China's strength and integrity.</p>
