<p>The fossilized remains of one the largest known sea turtles -- probably 20 feet (six metres) wide -- have been found in South Dakota, it was announced on Monday.</p>
<p>The South Dakata School of Mines and Technology said the skeleton was found near the city of Pierre in a shale bank last month.</p>
<p>The animal, called Archelon, had a shell 12 feet (3.6 metres) across and from the tips of its flippers could have been 20 feet wide and more than double the weight of today's sea turtles, the announcement said.</p>
<p>The turtle roamed the region toward the end of the age of dinosaurs, about 70 million years ago, when much of the area was covered by water.</p>
<p>The fossilized bones are not the first Archelon found in the state but comprise one of the most complete remains yet uncovered, the school said.</p>
<p>The skeleton eventually will be put on display at the school's geology museum.</p>
