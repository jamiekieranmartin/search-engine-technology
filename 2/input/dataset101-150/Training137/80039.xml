<p>Hong Kong's government on Thursday appealed for calm and Governor Chris Patten said he was saddened by the drowning of a protest leader who was campaigning for Chinese sovereignty over a disputed group of islands.</p>
<p>&quot;I was saddened to hear of the death of David Chan,&quot; Patten said in a statement.</p>
<p>Chan, 45, died after leaping off the bow of the protest ship Kien Hwa 2 in defiance of a blockade of the islands by Japanese coastguard vessels.</p>
<p>&quot;This has been distressing for us, and I appeal for calm from all,&quot; Home Affairs Secretary Michael Suen told reporters earlier when news of Chan's death broke.</p>
<p>&quot;I urge the community to react to this development in...an orderly and responsible manner,&quot; Suen said.</p>
<p>There were no signs of protests in Hong Kong over Chan's death.</p>
<p>Chan and four other protesters who jumped tied themselves to the ship and were dragged along in the wake of the vessel.</p>
<p>One of the other four protesters was seriously injured and flown to a hospital in the Japanese prefecture of Okinawa. The other three were plucked from the sea unhurt.</p>
<p>Hong Kong has been swept by Chinese nationalistic fervour for weeks since rightwing extremists planted symbols of Japanese sovereignty on the islands known to the Chinese as the Diaoyus and to Japanese as the Senkakus.</p>
<p>Both nations claim sovereignty over the islands.</p>
