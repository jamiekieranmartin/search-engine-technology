<p>The death toll from Typhoon Willie, which slammed into China's southern island of Hainan last week, has climbed to 38 and nearly 100 people were still missing, the official China Daily said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The typhoon smashed homes, washed away fishing boats and dumped up to 40 cm (16 inches) of rain on areas of the tropical island province in the South China Sea, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>At least 38 people were confirmed killed, scores injured and 96 still missing on Monday, it said.</p>
<p>Most of the dead were from Hainan's Changjiang Li county, where raging floods broke through local breakwaters, it said.</p>
<p>Hundreds of homes were destroyed across the island, tens of thousands of hectares of farmland swamped and thousands of people stranded, the paper said.</p>
<p>The total value of the damage and property losses caused by the typhoon was not yet available, but was expected to be very high, the newspaper said.</p>
