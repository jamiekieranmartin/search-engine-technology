<p>Beijing had told Tokyo to match its words with deeds and stop Japanese rightists from further inflaming a row over ownership of a group of islands in the East China Sea that claimed its first casualty on Thursday.</p>
<p>Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang expressed China's condolences at the death of a Hong Kong activist who drowned in the East China Sea after Japanese patrol boats kept his ship from landing on a disputed archipelago to claim it for China.</p>
<p>&quot;The determination and will of all Chinese people...to safeguard the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the motherland is unshakeable,&quot; Shen said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;We mourn the unfortunate fate of our Hong Kong compatriot...who gave up his precious life,&quot; Shen said.</p>
<p>Hong Kong activist David Chan drowned on Thursday after he leapt into the sea near the islands from the Hong Kong ship Kien Hwa 2. The chartered vessel had sailed for the islands on Sunday and twice entered what Japan considers its territorial waters.</p>
<p>Chan was declared dead when resuscitation efforts by members of a Japanese coast guard ship failed.</p>
<p>Japan had said it would curb further action on the islands by nationalist organisations, Shen told a news briefing hours after Chan drowned.</p>
<p>He said Japan's Foreign Minister Yukihiko Ikeda made the promise in a meeting with his Chinese counterpart, Qian Qichen, at the United Nations in New York on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Foreign Minister Ikeda expressed...(that Japan) cannot allow Japanese rightwing groups to take action on the Diaoyu islands issue,&quot; Shen said.</p>
<p>&quot;We, the Chinese side, ask the Japanese side to match its words with deeds,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The dispute erupted in July when Japanese rightists moved to buttress Tokyo's claim by erecting a makeshift lighthouse on one of the uninhabited islands, known as the Diaoyus in Chinese and the Senkakus in Japanese.</p>
<p>The row has united nationalist sentiment in China, Taiwan and the British colony of Hong Kong, where protests against Japan's control of the potentially resource-rich islands have become common events.</p>
<p>On Monday, Japanese patrol ships repulsed a flotilla of activists from rival claimants Taiwan and Hong Kong, which reverts to Beijing rule in mid-1997.</p>
<p>Beijing and Taipei, rivals since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949, agree the Diaoyus have been China's for centuries and dispute Tokyo's claim, which dates to 1895 when Japan defeated imperial China in a war and seized the islands.</p>
<p>Shen said Beijing was looking to Tokyo to cool the dispute.</p>
<p>&quot;We hope the Japanese side will take action so that the situation in the area will not continue to deteriorate,&quot; he said without elaborating.</p>
<p>In a related development, China's state-owned China National Offshore Oil Corporation said it welcomed a call from a Japanese company to jointly develop the islands.</p>
<p>A senior official at Japan's state-run Japan National Oil Corp on Wednesday called for joint exploration, saying cooperation could help ease tensions over the islands.</p>
