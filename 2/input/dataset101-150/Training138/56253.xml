<p>EU farm ministers began a potentially stormy two-day Council on Monday over whether cereals farmers should be paid less so that beef farmers can get more help in coping with the mad cow crisis.</p>
<p>Several hundred German farmers demonstrated behind barbed wire barriers outside the Council building, chanting &quot;Fischler out&quot; and &quot;Fischler the executioner of German farmers&quot;, a reference to Farm Commissioner Franz Fischler.</p>
<p>&quot;We are categorically against the Commission's proposals to reform the beef market,&quot; Gerd Sonnleitner, Vice President of the German Farmers Federation, told a news conference.</p>
<p>German beef producers, who were losing 400 marks for every bull sold, faced ruin, he added.</p>
<p>Germany, backed by most EU member states, also argues that cereals farmers, who have been reaping bumper profits from record world prices, could soon be confronted with falling prices as production rises.</p>
<p>&quot;It's unfair to make a permanent cut in aid after what may prove to be a temporary windfall,&quot; said one diplomat.</p>
<p>Germany says that savings could be made within the farm budget to find the 1.3 billion Ecus ($1.7 billion) needed in 1998 to ease the problems caused by the crisis over mad cow disease.</p>
<p>&quot;The discussion is likely to be long and heated but without any decisions,&quot; added the diplomat.</p>
<p>With mainland Europe worried about repairing the damage caused by the public health scare over the disease, known medically as Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE), Britain is unlikely to receive support for easing a worldwide ban on its beef exports.</p>
<p>British Farm Minister Douglas Hogg met Fischler on Monday to press the case for cutting a scheme to slaughter an extra 147,000 cattle most at risk of developing BSE.</p>
<p>A report by Oxford University scientists published by Nature magazine last month said that BSE would disappear within five years even without an extra cull.</p>
<p>&quot;The Nature article made it plain BSE will die out in any event by 2001 and secondly there is no cull policy which anybody remotely suggests could be adopted which will substantially speed up the eradication of the disease,&quot; Hogg told reporters.</p>
<p>&quot;The controls that we have...uniquely in place, both the 30 months rule and controls over specified bovine material mean that British beef can be eaten with complete confidence,&quot; he said, urging other EU countries to follow Britain's example.</p>
<p>Hogg is due to update farm ministers on BSE on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Britain has already slaughtered around 450,000 older cattle over 30 months old under a separate scheme.</p>
<p>EU officials noted that another recent British study found that mad cow disease could be passed from cow to calf, implying that more animals would have to be slaughtered to eradicate the epidemic.</p>
<p>They were sceptical that farm ministers would agree to any reduction of the British culling programme without a long and detailed study by EU veterinary scientists.</p>
