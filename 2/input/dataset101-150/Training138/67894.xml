<p>The German government, farmers and consumer groups quickly lined up behind the European Commission on Friday to oppose lifting a ban on British beef exports after London abandoned a cull of cattle at risk from mad cow disease.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel criticised Britain for its decision to pull out of a European Union deal struck in June to slaughter 147,000 British cattle most at risk from Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE).</p>
<p>&quot;A unilateral change by the British government is...not acceptable,&quot; Kinkel said.</p>
<p>&quot;The main priority is the health of the consumer. The ban on importing British cattle, beef and other products will remain in force,&quot; Kinkel said in a statement released in Bonn.</p>
<p>Britain's decision to ignore a vote this week by EU farm ministers calling to complete the cull aroused widespread anger in Germany -- one of the first European countries to slap a unilateral ban on British beef last spring after scientists found a link between BSE and a fatal human brain disease.</p>
<p>Britain said that a new study by scientists from Oxford University showed the cull was unnecessary because mad cow disease would die out naturally within five years.</p>
<p>Commission President Jacques Santer and Agriculture Commissioner Franz Fischler both said on Friday, however, that Britain remained bound by its promise to cull the cattle as part of a step-by-step plan to have the ban lifted.</p>
<p>Germany's Farmers' Association in Bonn said it was &quot;outraged&quot; by the British decision.</p>
<p>&quot;We call on the government and all other member states to exclude Britain from the European beef market until it fulfils its commitments to the European Union,&quot; it said in a statement.</p>
<p>Germany's 300,000 beef farmers have been hard hit by a fall of almost a half in domestic beef consumption in the past five years linked to the BSE scare. Price falls since 1994 mean they now get 400 marks ($270) less for each bull sold, a spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>Germany has also been swept by consumer health fears that humans could contract the deadly Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) from dairy products after it was found that cows could pass BSE on to their calves through their milk.</p>
<p>Baerbel Hoehn, Green Party environment minister in the most populous state North Rhine-Westphalia, said the cull deal had to be stuck to -- especially as it had been agreed before fears emerged over BSE-infected dairy produce.</p>
<p>Consumer groups also said they backed Brussels' position.</p>
<p>&quot;We must stick to this strict export ban until the whole slaughter is complete,&quot; Susanne Hampel-Masfeld of the Bonn-based Consumer Initiative group told Reuters.</p>
<p>Hampel-Masfeld said her group was advising consumers not to buy imported milk or cheese until the produce is given a clean bill of health.</p>
<p>&quot;We think that this whole problem is so unclear that we should be careful,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>The umbrella organisation of German consumer associations also slammed the British decision as irresponsible. It said the move could have waited until a meeting in October of Commission science committees to review the findings of the Oxford study.</p>
<p>&quot;Germany's consumer associations see no reason to give the all-clear,&quot; a statement said.</p>
