<p>The European Union on Friday flatly ruled out any lifting of a worldwide ban on British beef exports after London decided to shelve plans for a cull of cattle most at risk from mad cow disease.</p>
<p>Not mincing words, the EU farm commissioner and the farm ministers of France and EU president Ireland all said Britain must abide by an EU summit deal reached in June designed to defuse the so-called &quot;beef war&quot;.</p>
<p>Foreign Ministers Klaus Kinkel of Germany and Herve de Charette of France also said lifting the ban was now out of the question.</p>
<p>Resurgence of the six-month-old crisis is likely to inflame an informal meeting of EU farm ministers beginning on Sunday in Killarney, Ireland. It was otherwise intended to focus on ways to restore battered consumer confidence in beef.</p>
<p>Farm Commissioner Franz Fischler was first out of the blocks in attacking the British government's decision, which came late on Thursday evening.</p>
<p>&quot;As long as they do not meet the pre-conditions and until we have a working document from them which we can carefully check, then an end to the export ban is simply not a possibility,&quot; Fischler told the European Parliament.</p>
<p>He said that Britain was still bound by its agreement at the summit in Florence to slaughter up to 147,000 cattle as part of a plan that would eventually lead to the EU lifting its worldwide ban on British beef exports.</p>
<p>The British government decided to suspend the planned cull because of research suggesting that mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), would die out in five years.</p>
<p>Irish Agriculture Minister Ivan Yates warned Britain that there were no prospects of lifting the ban and that its farmers would be the biggest losers if it abandoned the cull.</p>
<p>But he told Irish national radio he would strive to resolve the impasse during the informal farm ministers' meeting in southwest Ireland.</p>
<p>Britain's partners were adamant.</p>
<p>Kinkel, whose country has been the most concerned about a threat to humans from BSE, said:</p>
<p>&quot;A unilateral change by the British government is...not acceptable. The main priority is the health of the consumer. The ban on importing British cattle, beef and other products will remain in force.&quot;</p>
<p>French Farm Minister Philippe Vasseur told French radio: &quot;The embargo remains, I'd like to add that I am going to ask for checks to be increased.&quot;</p>
<p>British Agriculture Minister Douglas Hogg said London had called off the selective cull because of fierce opposition in Britain's parliament.</p>
<p>The British government has been repeatedly at odds with its EU partners since admitting in March that a fatal, brain-wasting disease could be caught by humans who ate BSE-infected beef.</p>
<p>In Killarney, Fischler is due to present proposals for an EU meat-labelling scheme aimed at reassuring shoppers about where the beef has come from and how it was produced.</p>
<p>Beef promotion schemes, especially on foreign markets, and incentives for farmers to rear their herds in fields on grass rather than in sheds on compound feeds will also be discussed.</p>
<p>The Commission's chief spokesman, Nikolaus van der Pas, said in a statement that the Commission would stick to the Florence framework which was based on the latest scientific evidence.</p>
<p>But he added that EU scientists would assess the latest studies, one by Oxford University and another which shows that BSE can be passed from cows to calves. But it would take until at least mid-October before any conclusions could be drawn.</p>
<p>Van der Pas held out a ray of hope for farmers with grass-fed herds which were free of BSE.</p>
<p>&quot;The Commission remains open to discuss possibilities that may exist for a relaxation of export restrictions for animals from certified herds possibly on a regional basis,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Northern Ireland is pressing strongly for the ban to be lifted on its grass-fed herds, saying it has an effective computer system to track the origin and feed of all its cattle.</p>
