<p>Prospects of an early lifting of a European ban on British beef sales vanished on Friday after the government bowed to domestic political pressure and shelved a cull of up to 147,000 cattle most at risk of mad cow disease.</p>
<p>Farmers' leaders welcomed the decision but it drew an icy response from the European Union, which had insisted on a full-scale cull as part of a deal with Britain aimed at a gradual easing of the crippling embargo imposed in March.</p>
<p>&quot;As long as they do not meet the pre-conditions and until we have a working document from them which we can carefully check, then an end to the export ban is simply not a possibility,&quot; European Union Farm Commissioner Franz Fischler said.</p>
<p>British Agriculture Minister Douglas Hogg said London had called off the selective cull, which is in addition to a rolling programme to destroy 450,000 cattle a year over the age of 30 months, because of fierce opposition in parliament.</p>
<p>&quot;Any minister who wanted to get the cull order through the House of Commons would have to be able to persuade the House of Commons that member states would be able or willing to ... lift the ban. And many members of parliament are deeply concerned,&quot; Hogg told BBC radio.</p>
<p>Prime Minister John Major, who must call an election by May, has a majority of just one in the 651-seat lower chamber. He would have faced certain defeat had the cull been put to a vote.</p>
<p>Hogg said, however, that the decision, taken at a two-hour meeting late on Thursday, was also justified by new projections by Oxford Univeristy scientists that mad cow disease would die out within five years with or without a cull.</p>
<p>The European Union imposed the ban after British scientists disclosed in March a probable link between mad cow disease, or Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE), and the invariably fatal Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, which rots human brains.</p>
<p>&quot;The position of the Commission has not changed,&quot; Jacques Santer, president of the European Commission, told Reuters in Brussels when asked about the British decision.</p>
<p>Major's office said suspension of the cull did not mean the government was departing from the framework of a deal struck at an EU summit in Florence in June. This deal allowed the eradication plan to be &quot;adapted if necessary in the light of scientific and epidemiological developments&quot;.</p>
<p>Hogg did admit, however, that Britain could no longer hope for the ban on beef exports, worth 500 million pounds ($780 million) a year before the crisis erupted, to be lifted by November as Major had promised after the Florence agreement.</p>
<p>&quot;We will not be seeing the ban lifted by November,&quot; Hogg said.</p>
<p>Asked whether the ban would still be in place in five years' time, Hogg added: &quot;It depends on member states. There is a process which enables the ban rapidly and substantially to be lifted, but that depends on member states.&quot;</p>
<p>He said the strategy now would be to get the ban lifted first on so-called certified herds -- cattle primarily fed on grass that have no record of BSE. Such a plan, if agreed by the EU, is likely to start in Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>Sir David Naish, president of the powerful National Farmers' Union, said he would meet European Farm Commissioner Franz Fischler later on Friday to put Britain's case.</p>
<p>&quot;Our Scottish and our Ulster (Northern Ireland) colleagues do have many more herds that have had no BSE cases, and I hope we can help persuade Commissioner Fischler that this is a way to start the lifting of the beef ban,&quot; he told BBC radio.</p>
<p>Members of the ruling Conservative Party from farming constituencies, who had threatened to vote down the cull when parliament debates it next month, were pleased by the news.</p>
<p>But former prime minister Sir Edward Heath, a fervent pro-European, said: &quot;It will be interpreted widely that the British government reached an agreement at Florence and has now overthrown that agreement unilaterally.&quot; ($1=.6412 Pound)</p>
