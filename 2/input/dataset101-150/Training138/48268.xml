<p>The European Commission reacted calmly after the British government said on Thursday that new scientific data on mad cow disease should be reviewed jointly with the EU's executive.</p>
<p>Two British reports have shown that the disease, known as Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE), can be passed from cow to calf and that the epidemic would disappear within five years even without a cull.</p>
<p>&quot;We have always said that evidence on maternal transmission needs to be taken into account and we have asked the scientific committee to evaluate this,&quot; Commission agriculture spokesman, Gerard Kiely, told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;We have always said that the priority should be the protection of human health and the rapid eradication of BSE has an important role to play in ensuring that objective is reached,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the Commission warned that a British programme to slaughter 147,000 cattle most at risk from mad cow disease was an essential part of an agreement to lift a worldwide ban on British beef.</p>
<p>The warning followed British media reports that Britain was about to unilaterally scale down the cull.</p>
<p>In a statement, the British government said the new evidence should be evaluated in the light of the agreement struck at the EU summit in Florence in June that the British beef ban should be lifted &quot;on the basis of objective scientific criteria&quot;.</p>
<p>British Agriculture Minister Douglas Hogg is expected to push the reports at a meeting of EU farm ministers in Brussels on Monday.</p>
<p>EU veterinary scientists last week agreed to study the evidence on maternal transmission and report back in two weeks.</p>
<p>An EU multi-disciplinary committee, bringing together human and animal health, food and cosmetics experts, is also due to discuss the latest scientific data on Monday.</p>
<p>But EU officials said a review of selective slaughter programmes had barely begun and could take many weeks.</p>
