<p>The European Union on Friday ruled out any lifting of a worldwide ban on British beef exports until London respected the terms of a deal cut with EU leaders.</p>
<p>&quot;As long as they do not meet the pre-conditions and until we have a working document from them which we can carefully check, then an end to the export ban is simply not a possibility,&quot; EU Farm Commissioner Fischler told the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The British government said on Thursday it was putting on hold a cull of beef cattle most at risk from mad cow disease or bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) because of evidence from researchers that the disease would die out in five years.</p>
<p>British Agriculture Minister Douglas Hogg said London had called off the selective cull, which had been due to start on August 1, because of fierce opposition in Britain's parliament.</p>
<p>The British government has been repeatedly at odds with its European partners since acknowledging in March a fatal, brain-wasting disease could be transmitted to humans who ate BSE-inflected beef.</p>
<p>The planned cull would be in addition to a much bigger rolling programme to annually slaughter around one million cattle over the age of 30 months. Lack of incinerators to destroy the meat has resulted in a huge backlog.</p>
<p>Fischler warned that Britain was still bound by its agreement with the European Union to slaughter up to 147,000 cattle as part of a plan that would eventually lead to the lifting of its worldwide ban on British beef exports.</p>
<p>&quot;That is a question which the British government has to address,&quot; he said, adding that London's decision did nothing to improve the poor state of the European beef market.</p>
<p>European Commission President Jacques Santer said that Britain's decision to hold up the planned extra cull of cattle had not influenced the rest of Europe's view of the issue.</p>
<p>&quot;The position of the Commission has not changed,&quot; he told a Reuters Television reporter in Brussels.</p>
<p>Germany backed Santer's call on Britain to make the cull.</p>
<p>&quot;As long as the British government does not hold to the agreements of the EU agriculture ministers, we cannot accommodate it,&quot; a spokesman for the German agriculture ministry said on Friday.</p>
<p>The European Union says that Britain must honour the agreement reached at an EU summit in Florence in June on a gradual lifting of the ban and that new scientific evidence should not serve as an excuse for delaying the cull.</p>
<p>The Commission's chief spokesman Nikolaus van der Pas said in a statement that the Commission will stick to the Florence framework which was based on the latest scientific evidence.</p>
<p>But he added that EU scientists will assess the latest studies, one by Oxford University and another which shows that BSE can be passed from cows to calves.</p>
<p>In response to a question, Van der Pas estimated it would take until at least mid-October before the scientists would be able to say whether the selective culling programme should be adjusted upwards or downwards.</p>
<p>Van der Pas also said the Commission was ready to examine the case of grass-fed herds which were free of BSE.</p>
<p>&quot;The Commission remains open to discuss possibilities that may exist for a relaxation of export restrictions for animals from certified herds possibly on a regional basis,&quot; he said in the statement, adding that the Florence deal must be respected.</p>
<p>Northern Ireland is pressing strongly for the ban to be lifted on its grass-fed herds, saying it has an effective computer system to track the origin and feed of all its cattle.</p>
