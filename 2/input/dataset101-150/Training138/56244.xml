<p>European farm ministers attacked proposals on Monday to pay grain farmers less so beef farmers can get more to help them cope with the mad cow crisis.</p>
<p>Several hundred German farmers demonstrated behind barbed wire barriers outside the ministerial building, chanting &quot;Fischler out&quot; and &quot;Fischler the executioner of German farmers&quot;, a reference to EU Farm Commissioner Franz Fischler.</p>
<p>&quot;We are categorically against the Commission's proposals to reform the beef market,&quot; Gerd Sonnleitner, Vice-President of the German Farmers Federation, told a news conference.</p>
<p>German farmers say they face ruin, with beef sales plunging by 40 percent and prices down about 20 percent since the outbreak of the crisis in March when the British government said mad cow disease -- Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) -- could be transmitted to humans.</p>
<p>German Secretary of State for Agriculture Franz-Josef Feiter attacked Fischler's proposals to curb a growing beef mountain caused by the fall in demand.</p>
<p>&quot;They are ineffective and make certain regions in Europe pay for others,&quot; Feiter told reporters.</p>
<p>&quot;The (farmers') situation is extremely difficult. I would call it explosive,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Germany, backed by most EU member states, also argues that cereals farmers, who have been reaping bumper profits from record world prices, could soon be confronted with falling prices as production rises.</p>
<p>Feiter said that savings could be made within the farm budget to find the 1.3 billion Ecus ($1.7 billion) needed in 1998 to ease the problems caused by the crisis over BSE.</p>
<p>Before the meeting, British Farm Minister Douglas Hogg met Fischler to press the case for cutting a scheme to slaughter an extra 147,000 cattle in Britain most at risk of developing BSE.</p>
<p>The scheme was part of a package agreed by EU heads of state at their summit in Florence, Italy, in June aimed at gradually lifting a ban on British beef exports.</p>
<p>A report by Oxford University scientists published by Nature magazine last month said BSE would disappear within five years even without an extra cull.</p>
<p>&quot;The Nature article made it plain BSE will die out in any event by 2001 and secondly there is no cull policy which anybody remotely suggests could be adopted which will substantially speed up the eradication of the disease,&quot; Hogg told reporters.</p>
<p>Hogg is due to brief ministers on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Britain has already slaughtered around 450,000 older cattle over 30 months old under a separate scheme.</p>
<p>EU officials noted that another recent British study found that mad cow disease could be passed from cow to calf, implying that more animals would have to be slaughtered.</p>
<p>Ministers offered little short-term prospect of either reducing the British cattle cull or easing the export ban.</p>
<p>&quot;The Florence agreement is the only way to lift the embargo. Any other way would exacerbate tension,&quot; said Irish Farm Minister Ivan Yates, whose country currently holds the EU presidency.</p>
<p>Spanish Farm Minister Loyola de Palacio agreed but added that the new data should be studied.</p>
<p>&quot;As long as it's uncertain there is no BSE risk from Britain, there can't be any lifting of the ban,&quot; Germany's Feiter said.</p>
