<p>EU farm ministers prepared on Monday to start a stormy two-day Council over whether cereals farmers should be paid less so that beef farmers can get more help in coping with the mad cow crisis.</p>
<p>Police erected barbed wire barriers outside the Council building in preparation for a demonstration by German farmers.</p>
<p>Germany, backed by most EU states, argues that cereals farmers, who have been reaping bumper profits from record world prices, could soon be confronted with falling prices as production rises.</p>
<p>&quot;It's unfair to make a permanent cut in aid after what may prove to be a temporary windfall,&quot; said one diplomat.</p>
<p>Germany says that savings could be made within the farm budget to find the 1.3 billion Ecus needed in 1998.</p>
<p>&quot;The discussion is likely to be long and heated but without any decisions,&quot; added the diplomat.</p>
<p>With mainland Europe worried about repairing the damage caused by the public health scare over mad cow disease, Britain is unlikely to receive support for easing a worldwide ban on its beef exports.</p>
<p>British Farm Minister Douglas Hogg met Farm Commissioner Franz Fischler on Monday to press the case for cutting a scheme to slaughter an extra 147,000 cattle most at risk to mad cow disease, known as Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE).</p>
<p>A report by Oxford University scientists last month said that BSE would disappear within five years even without an extra cull. Britain has already slaughtered around 450,000 older cattle over 30 months old under a separate scheme.</p>
<p>But EU officials noted that another recent British study found that mad cow disease could be passed from cow to calf, implying that more animals would have to be slaughtered to eradicate the epidemic.</p>
