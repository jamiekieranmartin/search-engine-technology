<p>Prime Minister John Major set the scene on Wednesday for another clash with the European Union by saying Britain would review a planned cull of cattle designed to eliminate mad cow disease.</p>
<p>Major, under heavy pressure from farmers and members of his Conservative Party to scrap the slaughter of 147,000 cattle, said a cabinet meeting on Thursday would discuss new scientific evidence.</p>
<p>&quot;Nobody should expect snap decisions but it is right to examine and make sure the policy is correct in the light of new information we now have. There is no pre-ordained outcome,&quot; he told reporters.</p>
<p>Last month the government welcomed a report by Oxford University scientists predicting that mad cow disease, or Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE), would be over by the year 2001 even without the mass cull.</p>
<p>The Times newspaper said ministers were now likely to shelve the cull. This would undoubtedly spark a new row with the EU, which slapped a ban on British beef exports in March and only agreed to gradually start lifting it in return for the cull.</p>
<p>The ban followed a British government admission that BSE could cause the fatal brain disease CJD in humans.</p>
<p>The ban caused a serious rift with London and resulted in British ministers blocking EU business for several weeks.</p>
<p>The EU later suggested that the ban on British beef exports should be kept in place longer than planned in the light of evidence that BSE can be spread from mothers to calves.</p>
<p>The National Farmers Union (NFU), keen to settle the row so its hard-pressed members can start exporting their cows again, urged ministers to take their time and not do anything to provoke Britain's European partners.</p>
<p>&quot;First of all explore with Europe all the opportunies and then make a decision. Don't make a decision based on newspaper reports and scaremongering,&quot; NFU president Sir David Naish told BBC Radio on Wednesday.</p>
<p>But scrapping the cull would be popular with the more nationalist members of the Conservative Party, who are doing their best to put the party on a collision course with Brussels.</p>
<p>&quot;If these reports turn out to be right, three cheers,&quot; said William Powell, a Conservative member of parliament's agriculture select committee.</p>
<p>&quot;We have been without the export trade now for some six months. The Germans are making it plain that no matter what the science, they have no intention of allowing us to export again.</p>
<p>&quot;So why should we engage in a mindless slaughter, at staggering public cost, with no advantage in eradicating BSE, just because some ignorant Germans are determined to elevate politics above all else?&quot;</p>
<p>The Oxford scientists' report said 700,000 cattle with mad cow disease had been eaten, raising fears that an epidemic of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD), the human form of the brain-wasting ailment, could follow.</p>
<p>The row broke out in March after the government acknowledged there could be a link between BSE and CJD. British Agriculture Minister Douglas Hogg is due to meet European Farm Minister Franz Fischler on Monday to discuss the matter.</p>
