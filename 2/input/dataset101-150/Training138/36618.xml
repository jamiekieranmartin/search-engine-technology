<p>European veterinary scientists reviewed evidence on Friday that mad cow disease can be transmitted from cow to calves, but were not expected to make any recommendations, a European Commission spokesman said.</p>
<p>A British study recently confirmed scientists' warnings that the fatal brain wasting disease could be passed to calves, dealing a fresh blow to the British beef industry and raising German fears about the safety of British milk.</p>
<p>&quot;They are still discussing maternal transmission. We don't expect any conclusions today,&quot; Commission  agriculture spokesman Gerard Kiely told a news briefing.</p>
<p>Kiely said the issue will be discussed further next week by senior veterinary officials from the 15 EU member states and the week after by a multi-disciplinary committee of experts on food, human and animal health safety.</p>
<p>But he said the independent scientists could recommend on Friday if certain suspect tissues should be removed from sheep over the age of six months before being processed into meat.</p>
<p>EU Farm Commissioner Franz Fischler proposed in July to ban sheep brains, spleens and spinal cords from the human and animal food chains after French and British reports that sheep could catch mad cow disease in laboratory tests.</p>
<p>Spain, and some other member states which have not suffered BSE, complained that EU-wide measures were unnecessary and an unfair burden on farmers.</p>
<p>The scientists will only briefly discuss new data, raising doubts about a scheme to slaughter British cattle most at risk from mad cow disease, or Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE), and heat processing of gelatine, a beef by-product widely used in food and cosmetics, Kiely said.</p>
<p>Most time will be spent on the British study on BSE transmission which found that only one percent of British calves passed on the disease to their calves, but did not examine how the disease was transmitted.</p>
<p>The Commission said on August 6 that there was no scientific evidence that milk carries mad cow disease but this could not be ruled out completely.</p>
<p>Several member states have demanded further research.</p>
<p>In a separate move to restore consumer confidence, the European Commission is preparing a proposal for an EU voluntary beef labelling scheme.</p>
<p>&quot;It should be ready later this month,&quot; Kiely said, adding it would be in the interests of all member states to have labels showing where the meat came from and how it was produced.</p>
<p>Austria, Belgium and the Netherlands already have national schemes.</p>
