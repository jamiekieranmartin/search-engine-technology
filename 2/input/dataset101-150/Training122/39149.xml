<p>Pope John Paul ended a two-day visit to Hungary on Saturday that put close public scrutiny on his health. He looked fatigued on his first trip abroad since a hospital checkup last month.</p>
<p>The 76-year-old Pontiff, who plans a four-day trip to France later this month, flew out of Budapest's Ferihegy airport after a punishing schedule here.</p>
<p>His trip, to mark the 1,000th anniversary of a monastery at Pannonhalma, near Gyor, in western Hungary, was the first since hospital tests following an abdominal infection in mid-August raised renewed concern for his health.</p>
<p>He made the last leg of his visit from Gyor to Ferihegy by helicopter in driving rain and was escorted by the arm to his waiting plane by Hungarian President Arpad Goncz.</p>
<p>The Pope's white papal gown and white umbrella contrasted sharply with the black rain-soaked overcoats of Goncz and other Hungarian officials.</p>
<p>The Pope fulfilled all his engagements during the trip although a farewell speech from the airport tarmac was cancelled because of the poor weather.</p>
<p>&quot;We didn't want to risk the Pope's health,&quot; a Hungarian government official said.</p>
<p>The Pope looked tired during his visit and earlier had to brave a bitingly cold wind at an open-air Mass for an estimated 130,000 people on Saturday.</p>
<p>Joaquin Navarro-Valls, the Pope's chief spokesman and a doctor himself, told reporters the Pope &quot;basically...remains a healthy man&quot; and had no plans to stop the foreign travel that has been the hallmark of his papacy.</p>
<p>&quot;The tests in August didn't find out the source of the infections,&quot; he said. &quot;As a personal opinion, a hypothesis that could explain what is going on in the field of the infection is that it could be some intestinal weakness left from the first operation in 1981.&quot;</p>
<p>The Pope survived a 1981 assassination attempt when he was shot in the abdomen in St Peter's Square.</p>
<p>Earlier the Polish-born Pontiff met all 20 members of the Hungarian Bishops Conference, who said afterwards that he had appeared to be well. &quot;He seemed to be in pretty good health and full of energy,&quot; said Istvan Seregely, Archbishop of Eger.</p>
<p>During his two-day visit the Pontiff sought to promote a post-communist spiritual revival in Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>He told the Hungarian bishops that many younger people saw no need for religion and urged the Church to combat &quot;consumerist and hedonistic society&quot;, preserve the family and fight the &quot;culture of death&quot; of abortion. He urged the bishops &quot;above all (to) be defenders of human life&quot;.</p>
<p>During the last engagement before his departure -- a meeting in Gyor Cathedral with 1,000 clergy from the Gyor diocese -- the Pope  said the end of communism had not been a cure-all for society.</p>
<p>&quot;There has been no lack of disillusionment,&quot; he said. &quot;The return to religious practice has been slow. Difficulties have been placed in the way of the Church regaining the schools and institutes which belonged to her.</p>
<p>&quot;Do not let the ideals of solidarity and the sense of responsibility for others be eclipsed by individualism and selfishness,&quot; he said.</p>
