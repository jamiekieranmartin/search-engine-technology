<p>Pope John Paul held an outdoor mass in Brittany on Friday, the second day of his trip to France, in a region long a religious bastion opposed to secular traditions of the 1789 Revolution.</p>
<p>The 76-year-old Pontiff, looking relatively robust on the second day of a four-day trip testing his fragile health, waved to the tens of thousands of faithful before the mass in the northwestern hamlet of Sainte-Anne d'Auray in bright sunshine.</p>
<p>He ascended the huge blue and grey wooden altar platform, topped by a wooden crucifix, by a hydraulic lift out of view of the congregation, which fell short of the 150,000 people Church leaders had expected.</p>
<p>Despite chilly temperatures some of the faithful had camped out overnight in sleeping bags to ensure a spot near the altar for a view of the Pope, the first Pontiff to visit Brittany. Several dozen bishops and hundreds of priests also attended the mass.</p>
<p>The Pope, on his last foreign trip before going into hospital next month to have his appendix removed, was also to address 3,000 young couples with their children later on Friday.</p>
<p>He was expected to urge the faithful to spread the message of Christ and extol family values before returning to Tours, where he is spending each of three nights on the trip. So far he has avoided stirring controversy in France about his strict moral teachings or about the role of the Church.</p>
<p>According to tradition, Sainte-Anne, the Virgin Mary's mother, appeared to farmer Yves Nicolazic in Auray in 1624, ordering him to rebuild a ruined chapel.</p>
<p>Two men in traditional Brittany dress carried a golden-coloured metre-high (3 ft-high) statue of the saint to the altar.</p>
<p>Wrecked again during the 1789 revolution, the chapel was later rebuilt into a basilica which became a focus of resistance to a 1905 Republican law to separate the state and the Church.</p>
<p>Thousands of Bretons gathered at the basilica in March 1906 to foil the official inventory of church property ordered under the law. The government had to send troops to Sainte-Anne to carry out the inventory later that year.</p>
<p>On his first day on Thursday, the Pope and President Jacques Chirac sought to defuse a controversy in France over whether Chirac had been violating the 1905 law separating Church and State by partly funding the papal visit.</p>
<p>The Pontiff chose to stress solidarity with the suffering, the poor, the unemployed and the sick. Chirac welcomed him on his arrival in the western city of Tours in the name of a secular state proud of its historic roots and spirituality.</p>
<p>French newspapers reflected the French people's widely different reactions to his visit.</p>
<p>&quot;Secularism: the Pope and Chirac bury the controversy,&quot; the daily France-Soir said in a headline welcoming their efforts to avoid dispute.</p>
<p>&quot;Pope Jean Paul II's lesson in courage,&quot; the daily Le Parisien said, focusing on his struggle with illness.</p>
<p>&quot;The Pope is here: let's celebrate the Republic,&quot; the leftist daily Liberation said.</p>
<p>Sixty-seven groups including leftists, anarchists and freemasons are planning a rally in Paris on Sunday to back the secular ideals of the Revolution and protest against the Pope's ban on condoms, birth control and abortion.</p>
<p>Most of France's 58 million people are nominal Catholics, but only six million attend mass, and many of these believe Pope John Paul's conservative teachings are out of date. Opinion polls show most French people are indifferent to his visit.</p>
<p>Security was stringent after a crude bomb was defused two weeks ago at a basilica which the Pope visited on Thursday. The unknown attackers had scrawled &quot;In nomine-Pope-BOOM!&quot; on the wall of the crypt.</p>
