<p>Pope John Paul will undergo surgery next week to remove his appendix, the Vatican announced on Monday.</p>
<p>It said all papal audiences would be suspended from October 7 &quot;as a result of the Holy Father's hospitalisation&quot;.</p>
<p>The brief statement did not specify which day the Polish-born Pontiff, 76, would be admitted to Rome's Gemelli hospital nor when the operation would take place.</p>
<p>Chief Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls said the Pope would probably announce details himself in his midday address next Sunday after leading a beatification service at St Peter's.</p>
<p>Vatican sources said they expected the Pontiff to go to the Gemelli on Sunday evening.</p>
<p>The Rome newspaper Il Messaggero reported that the Pope would have the operation on the morning of October 7 and leave hospital on October 10 to convalesce at the Vatican.</p>
<p>The Vatican announced on September 14 that the Pope would shortly undergo surgery to remove his appendix.</p>
<p>It said then that periodic inflammation of the appendix was the cause of three bouts of &quot;intestinal fever&quot; which have ailed the leader of the world's Roman Catholics since Christmas.</p>
<p>The statement was issued by the Pope's personal physician Renato Buzzonetti following a flurry of speculation in the media about the health of the Pontiff, who has appeared increasingly fatigued and at times in discomfort in the past year.</p>
<p>It said other aspects of the Pope's health did not give cause for &quot;particular concern&quot; but made no mention of a violent trembling of the Pontiff's left hand.</p>
<p>Such trembling can often be a sign of Parkinson's Disease, according to medical experts.</p>
<p>The Pope had major abdominal surgery twice in 1981 after he was shot by Turkish gunman Mehmet Ali Agca in St Peter's Square and again in July 1992 to remove a colon tumour.</p>
<p>He also had hip replacement surgery in 1994 after breaking his leg in a bathroom fall and he dislocated a shoulder in 1993.</p>
<p>The appendix operation will be the sixth time the Pope has been taken into the Gemelli hospital since his election in 1978.</p>
<p>He will be admitted to a special, heavily guarded suite with its own chapel and kitchen on the 10th floor of the hospital.</p>
<p>Il Messaggero said the suite was protected by two armour-plated doors and bulletproof windows.</p>
<p>Vatican officials say the Pope is eager to be back on his feet in time to celebrate the 50th anniversary of his ordination as a priest in November.</p>
<p>He is due to lead a special mass to mark the occasion on November 1, the Roman Catholic feast of All Saints. Further anniversary ceremonies are scheduled later the same month.</p>
