<p>Pope John Paul was greeted by loud cheers and applause when he told French couples on Friday to respect life from the moment of conception in a speech defending Christian marriage and the family.</p>
<p>It was the Pope's first mention of sexual morality during a visit to France, where opinion polls have shown a majority of people in a once fervent Roman Catholic nation either opposes or ignores his strict bans on abortion and birth control.</p>
<p>&quot;You are invited to show the world the beauty of fatherhood and motherhood and to favour the culture of life which consists in accepting the children given to you and making them grow,&quot; the Pope told some 3,000 Catholic parents and their children.</p>
<p>&quot;Every human being that is conceived has the right to exist... ,&quot; he told the families, gathered to meet him at the hamlet of Saint-Anne d'Auray in Brittany, western France.</p>
<p>The Pope, 76, also praised marital fidelity and said the family, in France as elsewhere, faced not only economic and social difficulties but also moral challenges.</p>
<p>&quot;Like many parents, you are faced with the question of human and moral education of the young, while all around you awareness of the spiritual grows weaker and many essential values are being questioned, such as the indissolubility of marriage or respect for life,&quot; the Pope said.</p>
<p>He heard selected couples recount their problems. One woman, Anne-Marie Monroux, told him how she found strength in faith after her husband left her and their four children.</p>
<p>The Pope's four-day trip has been billed as a test of his ability to rally his flock in the face of controversy over the separation of Church and state in France and the Pontiff's own strict opposition to contraception, abortion and homosexuality.</p>
<p>Most of France's 58 million people are nominal Catholics, but only six million attend mass and many of these believe the Pope's conservative teachings are outdated.</p>
<p>The trip, the Pope's last before he enters hospital next month to have his appendix removed, has coincided with scandal for the Church over a Scottish bishop's reported affair with a divorcee and new revelations that he has a son by another woman.</p>
<p>The Vatican said without comment as the Pope arrived in France on Thursday that he had accepted the resignation of the bishop, 55-year-old Roderick Wright, whose case has raised fresh debate about the Church's insistence on priestly celibacy.</p>
<p>Earlier in Saint-Anne d'Auray, a shrine to the mother of the Virgin Mary, the Pope decried what he called a &quot;climate of indifference&quot; weakening religious following in France and urged Catholics to counter it by spreading the Christian message.</p>
<p>&quot;Too often the Christian faith grows weak, noticeably in the younger generation, which really struggles to acquire their religious heritage,&quot; he told worshippers at an outdoor mass which police said had drawn 120,000 people.</p>
<p>The Pope, who has appeared relatively robust since arriving in France despite his fragile health, has steered clear of many of the controversies surrounding his visit.</p>
<p>His address to families did not use the word &quot;abortion&quot; and it contained a reminder that separated and divorced couples &quot;remain members of the Christian community&quot;.</p>
<p>A French bishop ousted by the Vatican for his liberal views predicted on Friday that the papacy would rapidly lose its role in setting moral standards for Roman Catholics.</p>
<p>Modern society rejected &quot;this type of authority, and I think that it will end. This function of the authority of the Church will quickly collapse,&quot; said &quot;Red Cleric' Jacques Gaillot in an interview with France Inter radio.</p>
<p>Gaillot was ousted from his Normandy diocese in 1995 and transferred to a non-existent ancient seat in the Sahara for voicing liberal views on issues ranging from condom use to abortion.</p>
<p>Gaillot also faulted the Pope's plan to travel to the eastern city of Reims on Sunday to celebrate the 1,500th anniversary of the baptism of Clovis, the first pagan king in western Europe to convert to Catholicism.</p>
<p>He said the Pope's presence in Reims would seem to sanction the extreme nationalistic view that the baptism marked the creation of a Catholic France. Clovis's kingdom stretched from what is now Germany and the Netherlands into France.</p>
<p>Sixty-seven groups including leftists, anarchists and freemasons are planning a rally in Paris on the same day to back the secular ideals of the French Revolution and protest against the Pope's teachings on sexual morality.</p>
