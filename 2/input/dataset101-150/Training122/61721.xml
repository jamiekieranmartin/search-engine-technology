<p>Pope John Paul will be admitted to hospital on October 6 for an operation to remove his appendix, the surgeon who will lead the hospital team was quoted as saying on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The weekly magazine Oggi quoted Professor Francesco Crucitti as saying the Pope, 76, would enter Rome's Gemelli hospital on the evening of October 6, a Sunday, and that he might stay less than a week.</p>
<p>The Pope, who will begin a four-day visit to France on Thursday, is due to hold a beatification ceremony at St Peter's Basilica on the morning of October 6.</p>
<p>The Vatican announced last Saturday that he would enter hospital after that date for the removal of his appendix. It said then that an inflammation of the appendix was the cause of a fever the Pope has had three times since Christmas.</p>
<p>The Vatican was not available for comment on the Oggi article.</p>
