<headline>Yeltsin - long history of illness, disappearences.</headline>
<dateline>MOSCOW 1996-09-05</dateline>
<text>
<p>Thursday's announcement that Russian President Boris Yeltsin will undergo a heart operation follows months of speculation that the 65-year-old Kremlin leader had suffered a stroke, new heart problems or even a nervous breakdown.</p>
<p>Last year Yeltsin had two heart attacks. Statements about his health since then were contradictory and rumours abound in the Russian capital that he had a drinking problem.</p>
<p>Following is a chronology of Yeltsin's health problems, both real and rumoured, and of missed official meetings:</p>
<p>October 1991 - Yeltsin is ordered to take two weeks' rest after aides said he had suffered minor heart problems.</p>
<p>January 1992 - Yeltsin fails to meet Japan's foreign minister. Tokyo news agencies quote aides saying he has a heart condition but he reappears in good spirits 24 hours later.</p>
<p>February 1992 - Yeltsin tells French television: &quot;I have never had any heart trouble. Every day I have a cold shower -- I am in very good shape.&quot;</p>
<p>April 1992 - Yeltsin misses a meeting with then U.S. treasury secretary Nicholas Brady. He said he was working, the media said he was drunk.</p>
<p>March 1993 - Yeltsin, dishevelled, gives a halting speech which scandalises parliament and one opposition deputy says: &quot;The president was dead drunk. He's a sick man.&quot;</p>
<p>April 1993 - Yeltsin says: &quot;I have only two problems -- tiredness and lack of sleep. There are no other health problems.&quot;</p>
<p>September 1993 - Yeltsin, suffering back pains, invites a Spanish surgeon to Moscow who operated on him in Spain in 1990 for spinal problems caused when an airliner crash landed.</p>
<p>March 1994 - Two former Russian diplomats, quoted by U.S. NBC television, say Yeltsin has cirrhosis of the liver, a disease usually connected with heavy drinking. Aides deny it.</p>
<p>August 1994 - Yeltsin, visiting Berlin to mark the departure of Russian troops from Germany, appears unsteady after a champagne lunch and gives an impromptu performance, energetically conducting a police marching band.</p>
<p>September 1994 - Yeltsin fails to leave his plane to meet the waiting Irish prime minister during a stopover at Shannon airport. Aides said he had a slight indisposition due to the pressures of a meeting with U.S. President Bill Clinton. Yeltsin, leaving the plane in Moscow, said he had overslept.</p>
<p>December 1994 - Yeltsin has a minor operation on his nose.</p>
<p>April 1995 - Yeltsin's spokesman says he suffers from high blood pressure which can cause sporadic muscle weakness.</p>
<p>July 1995 - Yeltsin goes into hospital with an ischaemic heart condition -- a blood supply problem. He spends two weeks in hospital followed by two weeks in a sanatorium.</p>
<p>October 26, 1995 -  Yeltsin is taken to hospital and doctors say it is again an ischaemic heart condition. He moves to the sanatorium a month later and leaves on New Year's Eve.</p>
<p>February 15, 1996 - Yeltsin launches a vigorous campaign to win a second term in the Kremlin. But he has lost his voice and speaks in little more than a croak. He campaigns non-stop and shows no signs of health or drinking problems.</p>
<p>June 16, 1996 - Yeltsin wins 35 percent of the vote in the first round of the presidential election and faces communist Gennady Zyuganov in a runoff on July 3.</p>
<p>After the first round, Yeltsin effectively stops campaigning and cancels three trips.</p>
<p>June 28, 1996 - Yeltsin misses a Kremlin meeting with farmers. Aides blame a sore throat and say he is doing paperwork at his country residence.</p>
<p>July 4, 1996 - Yeltsin returns to Kremlin and his press spokesman says he is in &quot;fine working form&quot;.</p>
<p>July 15, 1996 - Yeltsin ducks a meeting with U.S. vice-president Al Gore and his aides say he has headed to the Barvikha health clinic.</p>
<p>July 16, 1996 - Yeltsin emerges from seclusion to meet Gore, looking pale and moving stiffly.</p>
<p>August 2, 1996 - A Yeltsin aide says the president is suffering from &quot;colossal weariness&quot; after his election campaign and needs two months of peace and quiet.</p>
<p>August 9, 1996 - In his first public appearance since June 26, Yeltsin takes his oath of office. He appears for just 16 minutes and speaks for only 45 seconds.</p>
<p>August 19, 1996 - Yeltsin's spokesman denies a report in U.S. magazine Time, which said that Yeltsin was to go to a Swiss clinic for a heart bypass operation after suffering further heart problems in the second half of July.</p>
<p>August 22, 1996 - Yeltsin briefly appears on Russian television, speaking to journalists and meeting new ministers.</p>
<p>August 22, 1996 - Yeltsin denies to RIA news agency in a televised interview that he is going to Switzerland on holiday.</p>
<p>August 23, 1996 - The Kremlin press office denies a newspaper report that Yeltsin is soon to have treatment at a special clinic.</p>
<p>August 26, 1996 - Yeltsin's office announces the president has gone on holiday to the Rus complex outside Moscow but remains in control of state affairs.</p>
<p>Sept 1, 1996 - The Washinton Post says the Kremlin is using old-style propaganda tricks to hide Yeltsin's ill health. Yeltsin's spokesman promises a new era of openness about the president's health but says he should be given room to take a break.</p>
<p>Sept 2, 1996 - Yeltsin is shown briefly on television for the first time in 10 days. Shown from a distance, he looks relaxed and tanned and a little thinner.</p>
<p>Sept 4, 1996 - Kremlin chief of staff Anatoly Chubais says Yeltsin wants to be left in peace to take a holiday.</p>
<p>Sept 5, 1996 - Kremlin spokesman confirms news agency reports that Yeltsin has agreed to have a heart operation which is likely to take place at the end of the month in Moscow.</p>
