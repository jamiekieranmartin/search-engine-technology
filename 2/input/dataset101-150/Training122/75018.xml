<p>Doctors decided on Wednesday to operate on President Boris Yeltsin's heart but said it would take up to eight weeks to prepare him in order to increase his chances of surviving and recovering full strength.</p>
<p>Following is a chronology of Yeltsin's health problems, both real and rumoured.</p>
<p>October 1991 - Yeltsin is ordered to take two weeks' rest after aides said he had suffered minor heart problems.</p>
<p>February 1992 - Yeltsin tells French television: &quot;I have never had any heart trouble. Every day I have a cold shower -- I am in very good shape.&quot;</p>
<p>July 1995 - Yeltsin goes into hospital with an ischaemic heart condition -- a blood supply problem. He spends two weeks in hospital followed by two weeks in a sanatorium.</p>
<p>October 26, 1995 -  Yeltsin is taken to hospital and doctors say it is again an ischaemic heart condition. He moves to the sanatorium a month later and leaves on New Year's Eve.</p>
<p>June 28, 1996 - Yeltsin misses a meeting with farmers between the two rounds of the Russian presidential election. Aides say he has a sore throat.</p>
<p>July 3 - Yeltsin fails to turn up to vote at his regular Moscow polling station as scheduled and votes instead at the Barvikha residence which also houses a medical centre.</p>
<p>August 2 - A Yeltsin aide says the president is suffering from &quot;colossal weariness&quot; after his election campaign and needs two months of peace and quiet.</p>
<p>August 9 - In his first public appearance since June 26, Yeltsin takes his oath of office. He appears for just 16 minutes, moves awkwardly and speaks for only 45 seconds.</p>
<p>August 19 - Yeltsin's spokesman denies a report in U.S. magazine Time, which said that Yeltsin would go to a Swiss clinic for a heart bypass operation after suffering further heart problems in the second half of July.</p>
<p>August 23 - The Kremlin press office denies a press report that Yeltsin will have treatment at a special clinic.</p>
<p>Sept 5 - Yeltsin, in a shock announcement breaking with secretive Kremlin tradition, says he has agreed to have heart surgery, later announced to be a heart bypass operation, probably to take place at the end of the month in Moscow.</p>
<p>Sept 12 - NTV commercial television says foreign doctors will participate in Yeltsin's surgery.</p>
<p>Sept 13 - Yeltsin goes into Moscow's Central Clinical Hospital for a weekend of pre-surgery tests but he stays there to prepare for operation.</p>
<p>Sept 16-17 - The Kremlin twice says Yeltsin's hospital visit will be extended, initially for two days, then for the rest of the week.</p>
<p>Sept 19, Kremlin spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky says doctors will meet on September 25 to set the date for Yeltsin's operation.</p>
<p>Sept 20 - Top Kremlin doctor Sergei Mironov says Yeltsin's surgery will be &quot;big and serious&quot;. He extends the president's pre-surgery hospital stay for a third time. Dr Renat Akchurin, who is expected to lead the operation on Yeltsin, tells a U.S. television channel that the president had an unreported heart attack in late June or early July, between the two rounds of the presidential election.</p>
<p>Sept 25, 1996 - Top doctors meet Yeltsin and rule that the surgery will go ahead but he needs between six and eight weeks of preparation in hospital to increase his chances of surviving the operation and return to normal life.</p>
