<p>Explosives experts defused a crude bomb planted in a French church which Pope John Paul is due to visit this month, police said on Tuesday. The unknown attackers had scrawled &quot;Pope-Pope-BOOM!&quot; on a wall.</p>
<p>The parish priest found the device on Monday night at a saint's tomb in the basilica of Saint-Laurent-sur-Sevre, a village 60 km (35 miles) east of Nantes, where the Pontiff is due to pray on September 19.</p>
<p>The attackers had lit a fuse leading to sticks of dynamite, but it failed to explode. The bomb was taken to Paris for examination while police launched an investigation.</p>
<p>&quot;There have been no claims of responsibility and no arrests,&quot; said Philippe Cailla, an official at the government prefect's office in La-Roche-sur-Yon, the capital of the Vendee region.</p>
<p>The Pope's September 19-22 visit has stirred opposition among both secularists and liberal Roman Catholics hostile to his conservative teachings on birth control, abortion and AIDS.</p>
<p>Bishop Francois Garnier of Lucon, in whose diocese the church is located, said the bomb attempt showed the need for tight security during the papal visit.</p>
<p>&quot;All those who have for months been making nasty statements towards the Catholic Church and Pope John Paul II should reflect on the possible results of their remarks,&quot; Garnier said in a statement.</p>
<p>Local priest Michel Simonnet declined to talk about the bomb, which had been placed on the reclining statue of Saint Louis-Marie Grignion de Montfort, an 18th century missionary.</p>
<p>&quot;I've nothing to say, I'll confirm nothing,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The bomb appeared to have been deliberately placed to alarm the Pope, who adopted the saint's Latin motto &quot;totus tuus&quot; (I am all yours), a symbol of devotion to the Virgin Mary, and had specially requested a visit to the shrine.</p>
<p>Bernard Lagoutte, secretary-general of the French Bishops' Conference, said he was shocked by the attempted bombing 16 days before the Pontiff's fifth visit to France.</p>
<p>The Pope will also visit Tours, Brittany and Reims.</p>
<p>Lagoutte said the Pope learned of Saint Louis-Marie Grignion de Montfort while working in a factory in his native Poland in his 20s and had even translated some of his works into Polish.</p>
<p>Pope John Paul has been the target of a series of attacks since his election in 1979. The most serious was in 1981 when Turkish gunman Mehmet Ali Agca shot and severely injured him at a weekly general audience in St Peter's Square in the Vatican.</p>
<p>In June, jeering hecklers in Berlin lobbing bags of paint gave the Pope his worst reception in years.</p>
<p>In France, about 500 to 600 people have asked for their names to be struck off baptism registers in protests at the Pope's visit. Others have accused the government and local councils of breaking the law separating church and state by taking part in funding the trip.</p>
<p>About 80 percent of France's 58 million people are at least nominally Roman Catholics. But church attendances are dwindling.</p>
