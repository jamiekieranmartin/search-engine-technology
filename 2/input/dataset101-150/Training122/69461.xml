<p>Pope John Paul talks openly and without fear of the day he will die and plans to lead the Roman Catholic Church for the rest of his life, French cardinals said on Sunday.</p>
<p>They gave a rare insight into the 76-year-old Pontiff's attitude to death and his papacy at a news conference shortly before he ended up his last foreign trip ahead of planned surgery to remove his appendix next month.</p>
<p>&quot;He speaks of his death freely and with a smile,&quot; said Cardinal Jean-Marie Lustiger, France's top Roman Catholic and a personal friend of the Pope's.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no fear in the face of the void,&quot; said Lustiger, the cardinal-archbishop of Paris who is tipped by some Vatican watchers as an outside contender to succeed the ailing Pontiff.</p>
<p>The Pope, who underwent major surgery in 1981 after an assassination attempt and again in 1992 to remove an intestinal tumour, has suffered three bouts of fever this year linked by his doctors to an inflammation of the appendix.</p>
<p>He has appeared fatigued at times and in discomfort but looked relatively robust and at ease during his four-day visit to France, warming to crowds and speaking strongly despite occasional trouble from a mild cough.</p>
<p>Speculation abounded when he turned 75 in May 1995, the age at which bishops of the Roman Catholic Church retire, that the Pope might also step down to make way for a younger, fitter man to lead the world's almost one billion Roman Catholics.</p>
<p>He ruled out retirement in a speech on the eve of his birthday, a position which Cardinal Pierre Eyt, the archbishop of the southern city of Bordeaux, echoed on Sunday.</p>
<p>Eyt said the Polish-born Pope showed &quot;extraordinary power of the spirit over the body&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;He gives the impression that when the day comes to lie down, he will lie down but that it will be Jesus Christ who will let him know when that day comes by calling him to the other world,&quot; Eyt said.</p>
<p>The Vatican announced the Pope's forthcoming operation earlier this month after a new rash of speculation about what ails him during and after a trip to Hungary two weeks ago.</p>
<p>The statement said the Pope would go ahead with a beatification ceremony at the Vatican on October 6 before undergoing surgery but did not set a specific date for when he will enter Rome's Gemelli hospital.</p>
<p>Chief Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls declined to elaborate on any details of the statement at a briefing for Vatican reporters during the Pope's trip to France.</p>
<p>The statement said other aspects of the Pope's health gave no particular cause for concern but did not explain a pronounced trembling of his left hand.</p>
<p>Vatican officials had long described the trembling, evident during the French trip, as an after-affect of injuries the Pope suffered during the 1981 shooting but have recently spoken of a neurological disorder.</p>
<p>The Vatican has not denied media speculation that the trembling could be a sign of Parkinson's Disease, a debilitating illness which can also affect speech and facial expressions.</p>
