<p>With former heavyweight boxing champ Muhammad Ali on hand, a drug company on Tuesday announced the first national Parkinson's study for minority patients, people particularly hit by the disease.</p>
<p>Caroline Tanner, a Parkinson's Institute medical officer, said at a news conference that about 35 percent of people with Parkinson's are minorities, but they represent only about 5 percent of participants in Parkinson's trials.</p>
<p>Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn said it would work with the institute in the year-long trial at 18 medical centres.</p>
<p>The 144 advanced Parkinson's patients to be enrolled would already be on the standard therapy of levodopa, but 108 would also be given Pharmacia's new investigative drug pramipexole.</p>
<p>Pharmacia senior vice president Jack Jackson said there was a low minority representation in its earlier clinical trials for pramipexole.</p>
<p>Tanner said the lack of minorities in trials was a problem because drugs may behave differently in different ethnic groups. The minority-only trial will include Parkinson's patients of African, Asian or Hispanic heritage, she said.</p>
<p>Lonnie Ali, who spoke on behalf of her black boxing champ husband, called on minority Parkinson's patients to enroll in the study to try to find the best treatment.</p>
<p>&quot;We need to find out what will work best in this initial fight,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>The disease, caused by a decrease of the chemical dopamine and marked by tremor, muscle weakness and a shuffling gait, affects about 1.5 million Americans.</p>
