<p>Pope John Paul arrives in France on Thursday in frail health for a four-day trip to a once staunchly Roman Catholic nation torn by controversy about the role of the Church and the Pontiff's moral teachings.</p>
<p>French President Jacques Chirac will greet the 76-year-old Pope when he lands at Tours airport in western France, the first stop of a gruelling trip that will take him to Brittany, Vendee and the eastern city of Reims.</p>
<p>On his first day, the Pope will travel with his Popemobile into Tours, have talks with Chirac and make a helicopter pilgrimage amid tight security to a shrine where a crude anti-Pope bomb was defused two weeks ago.</p>
<p>Unknown attackers had scrawled &quot;In nomine-Pope-BOOM!&quot; on the wall of the church in Saint-Laurent-Sur-Sevre.</p>
<p>About 6,000 police, paramilitary gendarmes, bodyguards and elite sharpshooters will be on duty to guard the Pontiff during his last trip abroad before he enters hospital in October for an operation to remove his appendix.</p>
<p>&quot;I intend to launch a new appeal for solidarity with all those who suffer in their bodies and in their heart, those for whom life is precarious and threatened, both in France and beyond its borders,&quot; the Pontiff said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Yet even though the Pontiff has avoided controversy in talking about his fifth visit to France, he has awoken unprecedented protests in a country that long vaunted its fidelity to Rome.</p>
<p>Apart from the homemade bomb, the most dramatic opposition was a group of custard-pie-throwing demonstrators who disrupted a service in Nantes cathedral last week.</p>
<p>Sixty-seven groups including anarchists, free-masons and a police trade union are planning a peaceful rally in Paris on Sunday, when the Pope will be in Reims, to protest at the Pope and back the secular ideals of the 1789 French Revolution.</p>
<p>They accuse Chirac of violating laws separating Church and State by partly funding the visit and celebrations of the 1,500th anniversary of the baptism of Clovis, the first pagan king in Western Europe to convert to Roman Catholicism around the year 496 in Reims.</p>
<p>Yet opinion polls show many French citizens are indifferent to the Pope's visit, and to arcane controversy about Clovis.</p>
<p>A survey published on Thursday showed that support for the Pope has waned since his last visit in 1988, reflecting French disaffection with the Pontiff's teachings against birth control, abortion or homosexuality.</p>
<p>Fifty-one percent either had reserves or strongly disapproved of his actions during his historic 18-year papacy, up from 26 percent in 1988, according to the CSA poll for the Le Parisien newspaper.</p>
<p>And only 22 percent of the 1,004 people quizzed from September 16-17 saw the Pope as being &quot;open to the world&quot; against 46 percent in 1988. The end of the Cold War has undercut the Pope's image as an anti-Communist crusader for human rights.</p>
<p>The Pope's trip on Thursday afternoon to Saint-Laurent-Sur-Sevre is to enable him to pray at the tomb of Saint Louis-Marie Grignion de Montfort, an 18th century missionary whose writings the Pope has admired for decades.</p>
<p>The Pope, who personally asked to visit the tomb, adopted the saint's Latin motto &quot;Totus Tuus&quot; (I am all yours) as a symbol of devotion to the Virgin Mary.</p>
