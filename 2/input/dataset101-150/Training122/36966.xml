<p>Pope John Paul visited a 1,000-year-old monastery in Hungary on Friday, and was left with time on his hands after a plan for a historic meeting with the Russian Orthodox patriarch failed to materialise.</p>
<p>Earlier the Pope said on his arrival that the people of Hungary needed patience during painful times after regaining their freedom from dictatorship.</p>
<p>The Pope drove to the hilltop Pannonhalma monastery in western Hungary where it had been hoped he would meet Patriarch Alexiy II, the head of the Russian Orthodox church. The Patriarch declined the meeting in July.</p>
<p>The Pope, who has suffered health problems in recent years, arrived at the monastery in a white &quot;Popemobile&quot; and waved through a bulletproof, plexiglass enclosure at a crowd of about 1,000 people who stood in the rain for hours waiting for him.</p>
<p>Although no alternative date to meet the Patriarch has been set, Pannonhalma's Archabbott Bishop Asztrik Varszegi, one of the prime movers in Central Europe for reconciliation of Western and Eastern churches, said the meeting was inevitable.</p>
<p>&quot;Such a meeting should not be long in coming,&quot; Varszegi said at a news conference after he welcomed the Pope to Pannonhalma.</p>
<p>&quot;I will continue to work on bringing the two churches together,&quot; added Varszegi, who has invited leaders of various Eastern Orthodox churches, including Serbians, Bulgarians and Romanians, to a meeting at Pannonhalma next week.</p>
<p>&quot;In a divided Christendom, we want to be brothers to all those who are searching for the road to unity,&quot; Varszegi said in remarks prepared for the Pope's visit.</p>
<p>Later in the day the Pope was due to hold talks with Hungarian President Arpad Goncz at Pannonhalma and to preside at the evening service of vespers.</p>
<p>He was also due to meet and bless retired monks and nuns at a hospice attached to the abbey, an event added after the meeting with the Patriarch was dropped.</p>
<p>Earlier, upon arrival from Rome in Budapest, the Pope walked from the plane without a cane and spoke clearly from his podium on the airport tarmac as he concentrated intently on his Hungarian notes.</p>
<p>&quot;The optimism linked to the historic fall of ideology has unfortunately been very short-lived,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;It has been replaced by a troublesome period of difficulty which in Hungary has marked and continues to mark the life of everyone.&quot;</p>
<p>The 76-year-old Pontiff, speaking in both Hungarian and English, said the people of Hungary must not be discouraged.</p>
<p>At Pannonhalma, Judit Nagy was one of around 1,000 onlookers who stood in the unseasonable cold and drizzle to catch a fleeting glimpse of the Pope as he drove past.</p>
<p>&quot;Unfortunately it was only a moment, but it was a wonderful moment,&quot; she told Reuters.</p>
<p>On Saturday the Pope will celebrate a huge outdoor mass in the nearby city of Gyor and meet Hungarian bishops before returning to Rome on Saturday evening.</p>
<p>The trip, the Pope's 73rd abroad, follows a fresh scare about his health in mid-August when he entered hospital briefly for a battery of sophisticated medical tests.</p>
