<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission Wednesday approved rules designed to give stock market investors a better chance at getting the best price for their orders.</p>
<p>SEC officials called the new rules the most important the government has issued since Congress mandated the creation of the national market system more than 20 years ago and required more &quot;transparency&quot; in market trading.</p>
<p>&quot;These rules are intended to empower all investors, by allowing their orders to compete on a level playing field, and by providing the disclosure they need to make informed decisions,&quot; said SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt.</p>
<p>The SEC's goal, he added, was to create &quot;one system where one price could be available to everybody.&quot;</p>
<p>The so-called order handling rules, which were proposed last September, were approved in a 4-0 vote. The rules apply to both the auction markets, such as the New York Stock Exchange, as well as the Nasdaq Stock Market, which has no trading floor but instead links dealers or market makers through computers.</p>
<p>The new rules require the public display of the price and the full size of customer limit orders when they are better than quotes by an exchange specialist or Nasdaq market maker.</p>
<p>The rules will also require specialists at stock exchanges and market makers on Nasdaq to allow customers to view price quotes from other electronic trading systems, such as NASD's SelectNet system and Instinet, which may not be readily available to them.</p>
<p>Instinet is an equities trading subsidiary of Reuters Holdings Plc.</p>
<p>The SEC's limit order display rule will mean a major change for Nasdaq, where such orders have never been displayed. While there was talk among Nasdaq market makers that it could mean less profits for them, Nasdaq President Alfred Berkeley sounded optimistic.</p>
<p>&quot;We support these rules because they will lead to better prices and narrower spreads,&quot; he said at a news conference.</p>
<p>&quot;This is good news for everyone --- investors, companies, securities firms, and the entrepreneurs of tomorrow.&quot;</p>
<p>Berkeley added that Nasdaq will pursue its proposal before the SEC to implement its Naqcess system, which will enable individual investors to place limit orders for Nasdaq securities that will be directly matched against other limit or market orders, bypassing dealers.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the SEC settled charges of alleged malpractices on Nasdaq when the parent of the Nasdaq market, the National Association of Securities Dealers, agreed to spend $100 million over five years to upgrade its oversight of dealers' trading practices.</p>
<p>Linda Lerner, a lawyer with New York law firm Singer, Bienenstock, Zamansky, Ogele and Selengut, called the SEC action &quot;dramatic&quot; and &quot;far-reaching.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This has  brought us much closer to the transparent, universally accessible market Congress envisioned in 1975,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Geri Detweiler, policy director of the the National Council of Individual Investors, said, &quot;This is great news for small investors, who have been waiting for this for a long period.&quot;</p>
<p>Small investors know they do not get the same treatment as big institutions in the stock market, she said, adding the SEC move will create fairness that &quot;will hopefully restore investor confidence in the market.&quot;</p>
<p>The SEC's chief of market regulation, Richard Lindsey, said Wall Street firms will probably need to spend about $7 million to carry out the improvements called for by the new rules.</p>
<p>The rules take effect 120 days after publication in the Federal Register for all exchange-listed securities and 120 days after such publication for the 1,000 most actively traded Nasdaq stocks.</p>
<p>Then, other Nasdaq stocks wil be included on a staggered basis every three months. All remaining Nasdaq securities will be covered on the first anniversary of the rule's adoption.</p>
<p>In proposing the rules last year, the SEC noted that while technology has improved, commonplace practices still existed that worked against investors' best interests.</p>
<p>It noted that customers whose orders were not displayed lost the chance of getting the best possible price available in the market.</p>
<p>It also cited the potential problem of a two-tiered market in which market makers quote one price to public investors while quoting better prices in private systems, thus robbing investors without access to &quot;hidden&quot; quotes the benefit of the best available prices.</p>
<p>The SEC dropped a third proposal that would have allowed investors with market orders to trade at a better price if there were shifts in prices before their orders were executed.</p>
