<p>The European Union will work to finalise its telecommunications liberalisation package and draw up a new action plan for promoting the information society during the final months of the year.</p>
<p>In new moves to bolster the EU's plan to open up telecoms markets to competition by January 1, 1998, the Telecoms Council is expected to agree an initiative on licensing phone companies while the European Commission will issue a much-anticipated draft directive on access to voice telephone networks.</p>
<p>The Council is also set to finalise legislation on &quot;interconnections&quot; between competing telecoms operators, data privacy and Open Network Provision (ONP) principles guaranteeing fair access to telecoms networks.</p>
<p>It will also try to resolve a sensitive dispute over how quickly to liberalise postal services.</p>
<p>Following are details of initiatives that are expected in the coming months, EU officials and diplomats said:</p>
<p>LICENSING. The September 27 Telecommunications Council is scheduled to try again to reach a common position on a draft directive setting up a telecoms licensing and authorisation regime for the post-liberalisation era.</p>
<p>Ministers were unable in June to resolve a conflict over the limits that governments may place on licenses once state monopolies are abolished. But diplomats said COREPER, the EU Committee of Permanent Representatives, was moving towards a compromise before the summer break.</p>
<p>The Commission's proposal, COM(95)545, would oblige governments to set up &quot;general authorisation&quot; schemes, requiring individual licenses only in specific circumstances -- for example, to allocate radio frequencies or numbers. But the compromise text would allow them to require individual licenses for companies offering voice telephone services or public infrastructure. That provision would be reviewed, however, on a specified date, a diplomat said.</p>
<p>SATELLITE COMMUNICATIONS.  EU member states are finally moving towards agreeing legislation on licensing satellite personal communications systems now that the text has been watered down to dilute the European Commission's role.</p>
<p>Officials are optimistic that the Telecommunications Council will be able to adopt a common position on the draft decision, COM(95)529, at its September 27 meeting.</p>
<p>The Council has up to now rejected the Commission's efforts to set up a single EU system for licensing the new satellite networks that will be able to offer telephone and data-transmission services via satellite.</p>
<p>Most member states objected specifically to provisions that would authorise the Commission to draw up criteria for licensing operators for the European market and play a major role in selecting the operators.</p>
<p>But a Council working group has made some progress on a compromise text that was drafted by the Italian presidency and taken up by the Irish presidency, officials said.</p>
<p>That text calls on member states to coordinate licensing activities within the European Conference for Postal and Telecommunications Administrations (CEPT), with the EU taking decisions only if CEPT does not act within certain deadlines.</p>
<p>Member states are set to discuss the text again in a working group that meets September 10.</p>
<p>ONP. The Commission is scheduled to issue on September 11 a draft directive to update legislation that applies ONP principles to voice telephone services. The existing directive, 95/62/EC, sets out rules to ensure that users and competing service providers have fair access to public voice telecoms networks. The Commission wants to amend it to take account of the EU's plans to open voice telephone markets to competition by January 1, 1998.</p>
<p>Rather than apply rules to operators with &quot;special or exclusive rights&quot;, the new text would apply provisions to all telecoms operators or to those with &quot;significant market share&quot;.</p>
<p>The November 28 Telecoms Council is tentatively set to adopt legislation, COM(95)543, to update two other ONP directives -- the framework directive, 90/387/EEC, which sets out general principles covering access to telecoms networks, and 92/44/EEC, which applies specifically to lines leased from phone companies.</p>
<p>The Telecoms Council reached a political agreement on the text in June. EU ministers are expected to adopt a formal common position as an &quot;A&quot; (non-discussion) point within the next few weeks and to send it to the European Parliament for a second reading.</p>
<p>INTERCONNECTIONS. The parliament is scheduled to give a second reading in September to the draft directive on telecoms interconnections, COM(95)379, clearing the way for final adoption under the Irish presidency. The measure aims to ensure that customers of different phone companies can communicate with each other once the EU opens its telecoms markets to competition.</p>
<p>UNIVERSAL SERVICE. The Commission is expecting to issue a communication on how to calculate how much it costs to provide universal service -- affordable basic telephone service to all citizens -- by the end of the year, possibly in November. That information is needed as governments determine how to cushion the financial burden on companies that will be required to offer unprofitable universal service.</p>
<p>DATA PRIVACY. The November 28 Telecoms Council is tentatively set to adopt the draft directive on privacy on telecommunications networks, COM(94)128. The legislation lays down rules for protecting personal data in areas ranging from billing to caller-identification schemes.</p>
<p>The Council reached a political agreement on the text in June. EU ministers are expected to adopt a formal common position within the next few weeks and to send it to the parliament for a second reading.</p>
<p>NUMBERING. The Commission is expected to issue a Green Paper in September on what kind of policy the EU should adopt towards telephone numbers in the post-liberalisation era. The paper will look at issues such as number &quot;portability&quot;, or the ability of subscribers to keep the same phone number if they change phone companies.</p>
<p>POSTAL SERVICES. The Telecoms Council will continue debating the draft directive on postal services, COM(95)227, especially provisions on how quickly to open up direct mail and cross-border mail services to competition. An orientation debate is scheduled for the September 27 Council.</p>
<p>INFORMATION SOCIETY. The October 8 Industry Council is scheduled to give the Commission guidance as it prepares an updated action plan for promoting the information society. The Council is expected to hold an orientation debate and to adopt a resolution identifying the issues the Commission should explore.</p>
<p>It will act on the basis of four initiatives on the information society that the Commission adopted in July -- communications on implications for EU policies and on standardisation, a green paper on social aspects and a draft directive on a &quot;transparency mechanism&quot; for monitoring national regulations.</p>
<p>The Commission is also set to adopt two new papers on the information society in the coming months -- a communication on the space sector that will highlight the growing importance of satellite communications and a green paper on exploitation of the information society by the public sector.</p>
