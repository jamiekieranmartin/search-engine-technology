<p>Cincinnati Bell Inc reiterated on Friday that it did not plan to split up the company at the present time, nor did it anticipate making a major acquisition or being acquired.</p>
<p>A Business Week article quoted a money manager as saying she believed Cincinnati Bell was an attractive takeover candidate and that its management might be mulling a break-up of the company.</p>
<p>The stock was up 1-3/4 to 51-1/2.  </p>
<p>Cincinnati Bell Chief Executive Officer John LaMacchia addressed those issues in an interview with Reuters published last week.</p>
<p>Asked if the company might split or spin off its fast-growing CBIS billing and MATRIXX Marketing units or its local telephone company, Cincinnati Bell Telephone, La Macchia told Reuters, &quot;Not at the present time.&quot;</p>
<p>Asked about acquisitions, he said while the company is always on the lookout for small, strategic acquisitions, &quot;beyond that, we're not aiming at any big targets, and no big targets are aiming at us as far as we know.&quot;</p>
<p>He also said Cincinnati Bell &quot;can't quibble&quot; with analysts' 1996 earnings estimates of $2.39-$2.40 a share, versus $1.72 excluding special charges in 1995.</p>
<p>A spokesman said Friday that the company has not changed its views since the interview.</p>
<p>LaMacchia said that the local phone company, like similar companies, faces uncertainties about competition and deregulation. In addition, previously reported renogotiation continues of a major contract the local phone company, which serves the Cincinnati area, has with AT&amp;T Corp.</p>
<p>But, LaMacchia said, the parent company is not at present considering splitting or spinning off any units.</p>
<p>&quot;Part of the reason is that a lot of the expertise that CBIS and MATRIXX bring to the communications industry comes out of their association with (Cincinnati Bell Telephone),&quot; said LaMacchia, who is also president.</p>
<p>In 1995 overall revenues were $1.34 billion.</p>
<p>He said CBIS, which generates bills and provides customer care services for cellular phone companies and other clients, accounts for about $450 million in revenues, and MATRIXX, which handles telemarketing calls, mainly incoming, for other companies, accounts for about $320 million.</p>
