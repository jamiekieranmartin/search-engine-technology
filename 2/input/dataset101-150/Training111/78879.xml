<p>Nasdaq, the national screen-based stock market, will launch an information campaign on Friday to begin telling individual investors how they can get the best possible stock prices when new trading rules go into effect next year, Nasdaq officials said Thursday.</p>
<p>The goal is to give the average investor the same kind of information available to big traders and institutions, said Michael Jones, head of the newly created Individual Investors Services office of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Nasdaq's parent.</p>
<p>The campaign will use newspaper and television advertisements to inform investors that they can use Nasdaq's site on the Internet (http://www.nasdaq.com) to get the latest information to help them make investment decisions.</p>
<p>The information will be available on the World Wide Web site beginning in January, when rules changes involving limit orders and stock quotes are expected to go into effect.</p>
<p>&quot;The communications programme ... will help investors understand how the rule changes can work best for them, while also equipping them with the latest in Web-based information,&quot; Nasdaq President Alfred Berkeley said.</p>
<p>The Web site will contain information like stock prices on a 15-minute delay basis and will also provide five-year historical stock price data.</p>
<p>It will also provide expanded links to Nasdaq-listed companies' Internet homepages to allow investors to access news releases and other information about those companies.</p>
<p>Nasdaq will also make available at the Web site a plain-English brochure explaining how investors can get the best possible stock prices on the Nasdaq market.</p>
<p>The new rules, approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission, require Nasdaq to display limit orders --- those specifying a customer's buy or sell prices -- that in the past were readily available to institutional traders but not to the average investor.</p>
<p>Nasdaq said it was expanding its use of the Internet because the Web is rapidly becoming the preferred way by which investors to get information, he said.</p>
<p>Nasdaq's Web site, which opened in April, now attracts an average of 1.3 million &quot;hits&quot; a day, he added.</p>
<p>The Consumer Federation of America said it was encouraged by Nasdaq's campaign because it should help small investors get a broad range of information on companies in which they may consider investing.</p>
<p>Barbara Roper, the group's investor protection director, also praised Nasdaq for getting more information out about the SEC's new limit order rules.</p>
