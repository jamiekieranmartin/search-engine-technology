<p>Argentina's governing Peronist Party supports planned measures to cut labor costs, Cabinet Chief Jorge Rodriguez said Wednesday.</p>
<p>Rodriguez's comments to local radio came despite the failure of the Peronists' national council to give outright support to the measures in a meeting late Tuesday.</p>
<p>After a three-hour debate, the council unanimously approved a general statement saying only that it backed government measures against unemployment.  </p>
<p>But Rodriguez welcomed the document as a gesture of support for the government and said that he expected Peronist congressmen to pass the measures.</p>
<p>&quot;We understand that this measure will have the support of the congressional wing, which does not mean it will not be debated,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Tuesday's document expressed the Peronists' determination to &quot;struggle tirelessly for the economic model to be complemented by the measures proposed by its political leaders to wage a firm war against unemployment.&quot;  </p>
<p>Leaders of the CGT union confederation, which is linked to the Peronists, attended the meeting, and the declaration made no criticism of Thursday's planned 36-hour strike.</p>
<p>Former CGT chief Gerardo Martinez said the document showed &quot;there was no support for the labor flexibilization plan.&quot;</p>
<p>Labor Minister Armando Caro Figueroa said the government might pass the measures by decree if Congress does not pass the measures this year.</p>
<p>The strike is being led by the CGT in protest at both 17.1 percent unemployment and President Carlos Menem's drive for fiscal austerity and more flexible labor laws.  </p>
<p>The package of labor laws includes measures to reduce restrictions on working hours and holidays, allow for salaries to be partly linked to profits, make overtime payable in rest-time, and create a private workers' compensation fund.</p>
