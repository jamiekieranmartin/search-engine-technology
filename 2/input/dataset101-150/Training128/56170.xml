<p>A U.S.-based human rights group appealed to Western donor nations on Monday for more pressure on India to free millions of child labourers.</p>
<p>&quot;The donor community should use its considerable influence to ensure that additional funds are made available to identify and rehabilitate bonded child labourers -- in part through fines collected through stepped up enforcement of the law,&quot; Human Rights Watch said.</p>
<p>The call, issued ahead of a two-day meeting in Tokyo of the India Development Forum, a club of donor nations and investors, argued that in spite of India's tough laws against child labour the government was not doing enough to free the children.</p>
<p>It accompanied an investigation report on bonded child labourers forced to work in misery for low wages in order to pay back debts incurred by their families.</p>
<p>&quot;Most or all of these children are working under some form of compulsion, whether from their parents, from the expectations attached to their caste, or from simple economic necessity,&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>The report put &quot;credible estimates&quot; of child labour at between 60 and 115 million. At least 15 million of them were working as virtual slaves to pay off family debts, said the report, describing them as bonded child labourers.</p>
<p>Voluntary organisations put the overall number of child labourers at 55 million.</p>
<p>The government estimates child labourers at 18 million, and says its first priority is to eliminate two million child labourers from harmful industries like glass-making, firework-making and quarrying.</p>
<p>Child labour is banned in India except where children help farms or small businesses run by their families. But officials say they face centuries-old habits, pervasive poverty and overwhelming social barriers as they try to tackle the problem.</p>
<p>India has been actively resisting Western attempts to link trade with child labour but it has at the same time launched a funding programme to help parents to take children out of work and send them to school.</p>
<p>&quot;Rulings by India's Supreme Court that bonded labourers must be identified, released and rehabilitated have been largely ignored at the national, state and local levels,&quot; the Human Righs Watch statement said.</p>
<p>&quot;India's trading partners should use the leverage of generalised system of preference (GSP) trade benefits to encourage the government to eradicate bonded child labour and to provide rehabilitation and education to the children involved,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Human Rights Watch said children slog to pay back debts as low as 500 rupees to 7,500 rupees ($14 to $215) incurred by relatives or parents. They are sold to creditors-cum-employers, the report said.</p>
<p>&quot;The children who are sold to these bond masters work long hours over many years in an attempt to pay off these debts. Due to the astronomically high rates of interest charged and absymally low wages paid, they are usually unsuccessful,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>The report said bonded child labourers were found in industries making silk, beedis (hand-rolled cigarettes), silver jewellery, leather products and handwoven wool carpets.</p>
