<p>South African legislators on Thursday approved legislation overturning strict apartheid-era censorship laws but retained bans on child pornography and &quot;hate speech&quot;.</p>
<p>The opposition National Party (NP), responsible for the original laws gagging political opponents and barring the publication of bare breasts, voted in favour of the new Film and Publications Bill.</p>
<p>But the right-wing Freedom Front (FF) opposed it as a pornographers' charter that would lead to increased rape and the liberal Democratic Party (DP) objected to a prohibition on publications or films which promote hatred against religions.</p>
<p>DP member Dene Smuts said this clause restricted freedom of speech.</p>
<p>&quot;For as long as race and politics intersect in South Africa, for so long will 'hate speech' provisions be vulnerable to exploitation by the strong against the weak, and for so long will they lead to self-censorship or the inhibition of debate about the very pressures we need to confront,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>The legislation bans child pornography and depictions of bestiality or sexual violence but allows soft porn to be sold to adults.</p>
<p>FF legislator Willem Botha told his fellow members of parliament that the availability of any form of pornography meant their wives and daughters were not safe.</p>
<p>&quot;The use of pornography is a disease like alcoholism or gambling, but worse,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Magazines like Playboy, Penthouse and Hustler were banned by the previous apartheid regime but became freely available after the constitution was rewritten to guarantee freedom of expression.</p>
<p>The new bill, which must be approved by the senate before it becomes law, aims to prevent children buying or reading this material.</p>
