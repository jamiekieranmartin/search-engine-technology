<p>Nationwide Insurance Co officials said Friday they would fight Florida insurance regulators' decision to reject a 27 percent premium increase, which went into effect May 31 and affects about 188,000 policy holders in Florida.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Florida Insurance Commissioner Bill Nelson said the department was rejecting the rate increase and said that the department may ask Nationwide to provide refunds to approximately 47,000 policyholders who have already seen their rates rise.  </p>
<p>At issue is a computer model used by Nationwide to calculate premiums.  State officials say they used Nationwide data to compare estimated risk with actual costs of four recent hurricanes and found Nationwide's estimates to be about 20 percent higher than actual costs.</p>
<p>The company had losses of $193 million from hurricanes Hugo, Andrew, Erin and Opal, the state contends.  Nationwide's computer model, however, estimated damage from those storms to be $231 million.  </p>
<p>&quot;The bottom line is that (Nelson) has said he does not want Florida consumers to be held hostage by a computer,'' said department spokesman Dan McLaughlin.</p>
<p>In a prepared statement, Nationwide spokesman Lou Fabro defended the company's request, saying Nationwide's homeowners' policies are &quot;woefully underpriced in Florida.&quot;</p>
<p>This is the first time a company has directly challenged the state over computer-generated data, McLaughlin said. Insurance companies in the past have based rate increases on computer models but have adjusted their rates based on actuarial data from the department.</p>
<p>Nelson is giving the company 60 days to provide additional information to justify the 27 percent increase.  Nationwide is Florida's fourth largest property insurer.</p>
<p>The company could challenge the department's action and could request an administrative hearing, a lengthy quasi- judicial process that could lead to a court trial.  Meanwhile, the rate increase remains in effect.</p>
