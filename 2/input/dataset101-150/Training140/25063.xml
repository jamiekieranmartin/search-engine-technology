<p>Investigators' computer simulation of the final moments of Trans World Airlines Flight 800 has placed the blast that downed the plane in a small site on the jet's right side, The New York Times reported on Friday.</p>
<p>The simulation shows that almost everything in the first spray of metal, luggage and other material blown from the plane came from a confined area above and ahead of the right wing.</p>
<p>Federal investigators say the simulation, a standard part of crash investigations, has helped them visualize the probable focal point of the explosion that ultimately split the plane.</p>
<p>The TWA Boeing 747 crashed July 17 into the Atlantic Ocean off New York's Long Island on a flight from New York to Paris. All 230 people aboard died.</p>
<p>Investigators examining wreckage from the crash say they have found several new hints that a bomb may have exploded at that area of the plane. However, the new evidence did not push them much closer to the point where they could officially declare that the crash was caused by a criminal act.</p>
<p>An aviation expert and a law enforcement official who is an explosives specialist both said they saw several fist-size holes that had been punched through the backs of two seats on the far right side of row 23.</p>
<p>That is in the centre of the area pinpointed by the computer as the site of the initial blast. Both the sources spoke on condition of anonymity, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>The holes in the sheet metal on the seat back are pushed through from the rear, indicating that the enormous force that created them came from behind. Row 24, the seats just behind them, is missing.</p>
<p>No similar holes have been found in other seats. The explosives expert said many of the pieces investigators do have hold &quot;very suggestive damage.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's where the violent event happened,&quot; he told the newspaper.</p>
<p>The microscopic traces of the plastic explosive PETN, discovered during Federal Bureau of Investigation tests, were also found in that general area.</p>
