<p>Early man walked upright from the time he came down from the trees four million years or more ago, and not in the traditionally accepted semi- crouched posture, a top scientist said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>A three-year study using a new computer simulation has shown that early man could not have walked in the crouched position with bent knees, said Doctor Robin Crompton.</p>
<p>Crompton, head of the University of Liverpool study, told Britain's main science festival that the simulation had been checked by tests on human volunteers asked to walk in a crouch.</p>
<p>&quot;Our research has upset the commonly accepted ideas about the evolution of human walking,&quot; Crompton told scientists at at the annual British Association meeting.</p>
<p>Quizzed by reporters after his talk, Crompton said: &quot;We are very, very, very confident about this.&quot;</p>
<p>The research used details from the female skeleton of a species of early man, Australopithecus afarensis, which lived in East Africa around 3.6 million years ago.</p>
<p>The skeleton is better known by the nickname Lucy, given to her by scientists who found her after the Beatles song &quot;Lucy in the sky with diamonds&quot; they were listening to at the time.</p>
<p>In the study, scientists built a computer model of the way humans walk now and tested it by measuring its predictions of muscle forces against laboratory tests on people walking.</p>
<p>Then they fed Lucy's proportions into the computer.</p>
<p>When Lucy's computer model was asked to &quot;walk&quot; in a crouch like a chimpanzee, she fell over. &quot;It is thus impossible that Lucy could have walked like this,&quot; said Crompton.</p>
<p>Crompton said anthropologists would now have to look again at when early man started walking. &quot;It suggests that any transition between quadrupedal and bipedal walking ocurred before our ancestors had left the trees.&quot;</p>
<p>Such a revision, he said, could push back the estimate of when early man started walking by anything up to a couple of million years, to between four and six million years.</p>
