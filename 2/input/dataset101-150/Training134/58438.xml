<p>The U.S. violent crime rate dropped by more than 9 percent in 1995, a statistic that won praise on Tuesday from President Bill Clinton on the campaign trail.</p>
<p>&quot;That's good for America,&quot; Clinton said at a stop at John Glenn High School in Westland, Michigan, referring to a Justice Department report that also showed dramatic decreases for rapes, assaults, robberies and other offences.</p>
<p>Crime emerged as a major issue in the presidential campaign this week. Republican rival Bob Dole on Monday vowed to wage an all-out fight on crime while Clinton won the endorsement of the nation's largest police group and defended his anti-crime record.</p>
<p>The Justice Department's Bureau of Justice Statistics reported an estimated 9.9 million violent crimes in 1995, compared with 10.9 million in the previous year, in what continued a downward trend that began in 1994.</p>
<p>Among specific crimes, the statistics-gathering agency said aggravated assaults decreased 19 percent, rapes, sexual assaults, purse snatchings and pocket pickings all dropped by about 18 percent and robberies fell 14 percent.</p>
<p>Attorney General Janet Reno said she was gratified violent crime continues to fall. She credited better law enforcement cooperation, attacks on gangs and drug rings, more police on the streets, new gun control measures and community efforts to keep young people away from violent crime.</p>
<p>From the mid-1980s until 1994 the crime rate soared, fuelled by murders and a wave of drug-related incidents in the inner cities involving deadly assault weapons. Experts have attributed the current decline to the ageing of the baby-boom generation past the prime years for committing crimes.</p>
<p>They also have cited better police strategies, improved crime prevention measures, tougher gun control laws and a dramatic increase in the number of criminals in prison.</p>
<p>The Bureau of Justice Statistics said violent and property crimes totalled 39.6 million during 1995, a 6.6 percent decline from 1994. It said the number of violent and property crimes reported to the police declined to 14.4 million last year, about 5 percent fewer than the year before. More than 60 percent of all crimes never were reported to the police.</p>
<p>The agency's annual survey was based on interviews with about 100,000 people to determine if they had been a victim of crime. Because it involved interviews with crime victims, it did not include murders. But the FBI in a separate report estimated homicides last year declined 8 percent.</p>
