<p>EVENING STANDARD</p>
<p>VIOLENT CRIME IS ON THE UP</p>
<p>Violent crime and robbery in London has risen by eight percent, according to new figures which show an overall national increase in crime of 0.4 percent. London was the only major city in the country to record a fall in the overall number of crimes, of just over one percent.</p>
<p>DEALERS HOLD BREATH ON INTEREST RATES</p>
<p>City dealers are waiting on tenterhooks for announcements from the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the U.S. Federal Reserve of any changes in interest rates. Few analysts believe the Chancellor will make any change to British rates, but opinion is split as to whether the Fed will make a quarter-point or half-point increase.</p>

<p>HOLIDAY GIANTS UNDER THE FAIR TRADING MICROSCOPE</p>
<p>The Office of Fair Trading is receiving increasing numbers of complaints about holiday giants, both from members of the public and smaller rivals, and calls for regulation are increasing. The complaints are related to the vertically integrated nature of the companies: two of the largest travel agent chains, Lunn Poly and Going Places, are essential parts of the two largest package tour providers, Thomson and Airtours, which also run their own airlines.</p>

<p>O'REILLYS TAKE A WIDER VIEW OF EXPANSION TRAIL</p>
<p>The O'Reilly family, owners of Dublin-based Independent Newspapers, is on the prowl for further acquisitions, following last week's offer of 234 million stg for the 55 percent it does not own of New Zealand's biggest publisher Wilson and Horton. The company continues to be interested in controlling Australia's Fairfax group, and may also expand in Asia.</p>
