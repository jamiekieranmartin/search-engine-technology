<p>A record 19.3 million pupils turned up for the first day of the new school term in Vietnam on Thursday, aggravating the government's struggle to find enough classrooms and teachers to meet their needs.</p>
<p>State-run media said there was a shortage of more than 100,000 teachers and, not counting schools in the north that were washed away or damaged in recent flooding, the country was short 15,000 classrooms.</p>
<p>The number of pupils enrolling was 1.5 million more than last year, largely because of an &quot;All children go to school&quot; drive by the government.</p>
<p>Although one of the poorest countries in the world, Vietnam's 75 million people are better educated than those of most other developing nations.</p>
<p>According to a recent United Nations report, the adult literacy rate in 1993 was 92.5 percent.</p>
<p>At its policy-defining congress two months ago, the Communist Party made education one of the priorities in its drive for &quot;industrialisation and modernisation&quot;.</p>
<p>It pledged to eradicate illiteracy among young adults and give everyone a primary education.</p>
<p>President Le Duc Anh, in a letter to teachers and students, cited the revered and revolutionary father of modern-day Vietnam, Ho Chi Minh, as saying: &quot;Whether Vietnam can be glorious and match the world depends on your study&quot;.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Education Minister Tran Hong Quan told the official Communist Party daily Nhan Dan that there had been no real growth in the budget for education.</p>
<p>Vietnam's teachers are paid less than $30 a month and in rural and mountainous regions some receive as little as $6 a month.</p>
