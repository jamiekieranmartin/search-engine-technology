<p>The French government announced on Monday a draft anti-poverty plan which it said would create 300,000 jobs and 100,000 subsidised homes over five years.</p>
<p>Government officials portrayed the plan as the fulfilment of President Jacques Chirac's pledge, made during last year's presidential campaign, to heal social divisions.</p>
<p>&quot;This is not a matter of creating new rights for those who have been excluded from society, but of providing them access to the same rights as everyone else,&quot; Labour Minister Jacques Barrot said.</p>
<p>The jobs will be for at least 30 hours a week and pay around 5,500 francs ($1,100) a month, with half to be paid by the state and half by employers over the five-year period.</p>
<p>The draft plan, which must be approved by parliament, would also enable homeless individuals to vote and make it easier for poor families to obtain subsidised housing together rather than be broken up.</p>
<p>It also would beef up state programmes to combat illiteracy and tuberculosis.</p>
<p>The proposal would cost the government some 500 million francs ($100 million) during its first year, but the funds would be diverted from other programmes, Barrot said.</p>
<p>The ruling RPR Gaullist party hailed the plan as marking the government's will to restore genuine &quot;fraternity&quot; in the country.</p>
<p>But the opposition Socialist Party, while declaring the plan &quot;commendable&quot;, said not enough money was being committed, given the magnitude of the problem.</p>
<p>The party's youth wing said diverting funds from other welfare programmes meant &quot;taking from the poor to give to the destitute&quot; and called the plan deceitful.</p>
<p>The Greens movement said the plan lacked long-term measures to stop poverty spreading and called for an in-depth tax reform to redistribute wealth.</p>
