<p>If European Union governments are really serious about fighting fraud, they should give the EU the powers to act, the European Commission and the European Parliament agreed on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;We must organise our fight against organised crime in a far more effective manner,&quot; anti-fraud Commissioner Anita Gradin told Euro-MPs during a debate on ways of improving the fight against fraud.</p>
<p>She said that as part of their discussions on reform of the EU treaties in the inter-governmental conference (IGC) the member states should give the EU the powers to legislate on fraud, border controls, judicial affairs and other areas currently dealt with through government-to-government cooperation.</p>
<p>&quot;The IGC therefore will have to determine a firm legal basis for fighting against fraud, not just fraud in European Union money but fraud in the member states' own resources as well,&quot; the Swedish Commissioner said.</p>
<p>&quot;We have to be able to provide taxpayers with guarantees that their money will end up in the right pockets and won't be used to line the pockets of criminals.&quot;</p>
<p>The subsidiarity-conscious EU governments have agreed to cooperate through international conventions, such as the Convention for the Protection of the European Community Financial Interests, but these have not yet been ratified and do not cover important matters such as extradition for financial crimes.</p>
<p>Parliament adopted a report by Dietmut Theato, the German Christian Democrat chairwoman of the budgetary control committee, urging the European Commission and the member states to take action to make the fight against fraud more effective.</p>
<p>As well as demanding changes to the EU treaty to bring anti-fraud measures under Community competence, MEPs said the member states should bring their laws and judicial procedures into line.</p>
<p>They urged the member states to step up their existing judicial and administrative cooperation, and said the Commission's anti-fraud unit (UCLAF) needed a statute which would allow it to fight fraud at all levels.</p>
<p>In a separate report, by German Socialist Rosemarie Wemheuer, MEPs asked the Commission to check whether the complexity of certain EU laws made fraud easier.</p>
<p>It should also see whether certain EU subsidies and refunds should be replaced by mechanisms less open to fraud, the report said.</p>
