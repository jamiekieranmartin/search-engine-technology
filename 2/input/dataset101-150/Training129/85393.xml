<p>International financier and philanthropist George Soros, blasting the recently enacted welfare reform bill as unfair and unwise, said on Monday he would give $50 million to aid legal immigrants in the United States.</p>
<p>&quot;The Statue of Liberty embraces those 'yearning to breath free,' but the current mean-spirited attack on immigrants threatens to choke them,&quot; said Soros, who emigrated from Hungary to England in 1947 and to the United States in 1956.</p>
<p>The money will go to a new charity, the Emma Lazarus Fund, to pay for direct assistance to legal immigrants and help them attain citizenship. The fund is an offshoot of the Open Society Institute and other Soros philanthropies, which spent $350 million in 1995 mostly in formerly communist countries, Haiti and South Africa.</p>
<p>Under the new welfare reform, legal immigrants can be denied Food Stamps, Medicaid and other federal benefits although states have some flexibility in implementing the law.</p>
<p>&quot;As a result of recent legislation, at least one million legal immigrants stand to lose benefits,&quot; Soros said at a press briefing, noting that such immigrants pay taxes and can be drafted into the military. &quot;I am appalled by Congress's recent action to deny vital public assistance to non-citizens who are lawfully resident.&quot;</p>
<p>Soros said he also hoped to influence the public debate over welfare and immigration with the fund. The fund will back organizations conducting legal or public education efforts on behalf of immigrants, he said.</p>
<p>Announcing the fund just five weeks before the U.S. elections was intended to stoke the debate over welfare, Soros said, but he declined to make any endorsements. &quot;I genuinely hope that it becomes a non-partisan issue because it has a much better chance of being addressed,&quot; Soros said.</p>
<p>Soros, 66, has made a multi-billion dollar fortune playing world financial markets for 27 years.</p>
<p>The professional fund manager kept his widely-followed views of markets out of the news at Monday's press conference, however. Asked about the effectiveness of Japanese currency policies, Soros would say only &quot;I hope that Japan will take another look at the way it treats Burma.&quot;</p>
