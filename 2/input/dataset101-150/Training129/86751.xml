<p>Japan's Ministry of Finance (MOF) is considering a set of deregulatory measures for the country's non-life insurance sector, such as lifting a ban on mail-order sales of auto insurance policies, industry sources said on Monday.</p>
<p>With the deregulatory measures, Japan hopes to find a quick solution to its long-simmering dispute with Washington over how to open up its $382 billion insurance market, they said.</p>
<p>The ministry said it plans to hold a media briefing on the insurance issue at 4.00 p.m. (0700 GMT) on Monday, following planned high-level bilateral insurance talks in Washington between Finance Minister Wataru Kubo and senior U.S. trade negotiator Charlene Barshefsky.  </p>
<p>At the Washington meeting, Kubo is expected to try to wring concessions from the United States through the unveiling of deregulatory measures in the non-life insurance sector.</p>
<p>In the set of deregulatory steps which have been disclosed to the non-life insurance industry here, the ministry plans to lift the ban on mail-order sales of auto insurance to individuals as of October 1, the industry sources said.</p>
<p>Doing so would make it possible for clients to buy policies without the need for insurance agents, and make it easier for foreign firms and domestic non-insurance firms to enter the auto insurance sector even without insurance agent networks.  </p>
<p>But the ministry did not include any steps in the package to deregulate the current system of setting premium rates for auto insurance, the industry sources said.</p>
<p>Japanese non-life insurance companies have expressed strong concern over any further liberalisation in the way premium rates are set for car insurance policies. &quot;Lifting a ban on mail-order sales would not cause a problem, but if the premium rates were to be liberalised, that would lead to higher premium rates for young people who have a higher accident rate. This could result in a higher number of car drivers with no insurance,&quot; one non-life insurance company official said.  </p>
<p>In the deregulation package, the ministry is also considering easing restrictions on sales of fire insurance policies to corporations, the industry sources said.</p>
<p>The ministry plans to allow insurance firms by as early as April 1998 to freely set premium rates for corporate fire insurance policies that offer over 15 billion yen in coverage. At present, the firms can freely set premium rates for such policies that offer more than 30 billion yen in coverage.</p>
<p>The ministry is also considering increasing the number of insurance products that can be sold without the ministry's permission, the industry sources said.  </p>
<p>Washington has accused Tokyo of reneging on a 1994 bilateral insurance pact by moving to deregulate its so-called &quot;third sector&quot; niche market, which covers personal accident and health care insurance among others, before opening its primary life and casualty markets. Foreign firms have a strong foothold in the third sector.</p>
<p>Japan's life and non-life insurance companies are due to be allowed to enter each others' business territory through subsidiaries from Tuesday.</p>
<p>A senior Japanese Finance Ministry official said in Washington on Monday that Japan told the United States that it may delay Japanese insurance subsidiaries' entry into the third-sector market until January 1.</p>
<p>The official added that the conditions for operating in the third sector market will be presented to the insurance subsidiaries on September 30 as planned.</p>
