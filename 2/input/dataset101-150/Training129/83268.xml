<headline>UAE extends illegal immigrants' amnesty by month.</headline>
<dateline>DUBAI 1996-09-28</dateline>

<p>The United Arab Emirates on Saturday said it had extended by one month an amnesty for illegal immigrants to get their papers in order or leave the country.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of illegal immigrant workers -- mostly from the Indian subcontinent but also from southeast Asia -- have been scrambling to get out of the Gulf oil state by planes and boats in order to avoid tough new penalties when the amnesty expires and a new law cracking down on illegal labour comes into force.</p>
<p>The previous amnesty was due to expire on October 1, and with airlines and shipping companies unable to cope with the mass exodus, diplomats feared thousands would be stranded in the UAE after the deadline.</p>
<p>&quot;The interior ministry has extended the amnesty for one month,&quot; a government spokesman told Reuters.</p>
<p>The UAE government says the new law will help curb the spiralling number of illegal aliens, who it says pose a security threat to the country.</p>
<p>Diplomats expect some 200,000 illegal aliens to try to leave the country before the law catches up with them. Embassies say they have only issued about 100,000 exit permits thus far. Many diplomats feared a mad rush for the permits as the deadline approached.</p>
<p>Foreigners make up 75 percent of the population in the UAE. Many come to the country legally, obtaining a work permit stipulating they have to work for their sponsor.</p>
<p>But large numbers break the law by overstaying their welcome or absconding from their sponsors for what they say is better treatment or pay with other employers.</p>
<p>The practices have always been illegal, but the new law imposes stricter punishment for offenders.</p>
<p>For over a week, all flights to cities such a New Delhi, Bombay and Manila before the previous deadline have been booked solid. Tickets for a 2,000-person ship to India, which was due to leave on September 30, were sold out in hours.</p>
