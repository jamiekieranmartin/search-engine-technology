<p>As the battle against illegal immigration into the United States rages, a study released on Tuesday shows the number of illegal immigrants in California actually declined in the early 1990s.</p>
<p>Research at The Policy Institute of California reveals that from 1990 to 1993 the net number of undocumented aliens in the state fell to an average 125,000 annually from around 200,000 in the late 1980s. The net figure dropped below 100,000 in 1992.</p>
<p>From 1980 to 1985 net immigration, which excludes immigrants staying in the United States for short periods before returning home, averaged about 100,000 a year. Undocumented immigrants comprised 22 to 31 percent, or 1.3 to 2.2 million, of the total six million new residents who came to the state during the 1980s. California currently has a population of roughly 35 million.</p>
<p>&quot;The net flows (of immigrants) are broadly consistent with economic factors in California and Mexico,&quot; Hans Johnson, who headed up the research group, said in an interview.</p>
<p>The study points to the booming California economy in the late 1980's as likely spurring illegal job seekers into crossing the U.S. border. But in the early 1990s, the state's economy slipped into a deep recession, causing sharp declines in employment. And in the early 1980s, California experienced slow growth.</p>
<p>The jobs data would seem to bolster arguments for immigration reform, many of which centre on the notion that undocumented immigrants are taking jobs from citizens.</p>
<p>The report's unveiling comes at an awkward time for conservative politicians, including California Governor Pete Wilson, who have taken a hardline approach to undocumented immigration. They argue it is on the increase and must be stemmed to save tax-payer dollars.</p>
<p>Congress is trying to finalise an immigration bill passed by both houses earlier this year. The key sticking point centres on a provision that would deny public education to children of undocumented aliens.</p>
<p>President Bill Clinton has vowed to veto the bill if it contains that provision.</p>
<p>The study &quot;reflects the fact that proposals dealing with immigration result from politician's scapegoating immigrants to further their own political careers,&quot; said Mark Silverman of the San Francisco-based Immigrant Legal Resource centre.</p>
<p>Along with economic factors, Johnson also cited the federal Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 as contributing to the late 1980's influx.</p>
<p>That law made it easier for undocumented foreigners living in the U.S. to apply for legal residency status, and prompted a rise in the number of wives, children and relatives joining family members, according to researchers.</p>
<p>Johnson said the research group does not yet have data from 1994 to present. Those numbers will be telling because the California economy has been growing again while the Mexican economy has struggled. Looking at the results of the study, Johnson said net immigration would likely rise.</p>
<p>However, he noted funding for border patrols also has increased in those years, leading to stricter policing of the U.S. border with Mexico.</p>
