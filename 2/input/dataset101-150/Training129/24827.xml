<p>Philip Morris has received a federal grand jury subpoena demanding testimony by executives and documents as part of a fraud investigation into the tobacco industry, the company and U.S. Justice Department sources said on Friday.</p>
<p>Department sources said the subpoena from the grand jury in Washington, D.C., went out on Tuesday and that it was the first one since the focus of the wide-ranging criminal investigation shifted to allegations of fraud by the industry.</p>
<p>In a brief statement, Philip Morris, the world's largest cigarette maker, confirmed the investigation. &quot;The company has received requests for documents and testimony and is cooperating fully,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>A Justice Department source described the long-running investigation as moving ahead, but said prosecutors still were gathering evidence and were not close to making any decisions about whether to bring criminal charges.</p>
<p>Other department officials have said that if charges do come out of the probe, they most likely would not be brought until next year due to the complexity of the investigation.</p>
<p>In July, a source familiar with the investigation told Reuters the focus of the probe now covered fraud allegations that the tobacco industry withheld information and lied to federal agencies.</p>
<p>The probe previously had centred on accusations that the heads of the major cigarette companies committed perjury when they testified before Congress in 1994 that nicotine was not addictive.</p>
<p>The fraud allegations might be easier to prove and would allow prosecutors to bring charges against cigarette companies, not just individuals, for deceiving federal agencies, the source said.</p>
<p>A Justice Department official this week said the perjury part of the probe had not been dropped completely, even though the focus had shifted to the fraud allegations.</p>
<p>CBS News, which first disclosed the Philip Morris subpoena, reported that similar subpoenas may soon be issued to other leading tobacco companies.</p>
<p>The investigation stemmed from a 1994 request by Representative Martin Meehan, D-Massachusetts, for an inquiry into whether the tobacco industry illegally withheld information about the dangers of tobacco from Congress, federal agencies and the public.</p>
<p>There are also a number of other tobacco-related investigations by the Justice Department, including one in New York probing the industry for securities fraud. A grand jury is is considering whether tobacco companies deceived shareholders about what they knew about the health risks of smoking.</p>
