<p>A close ally of Bob Dole on Monday lashed out at advisers urging the Republican presidential candidate to let an illegal immigration bill die so as to deny President Clinton credit for signing it.</p>
<p>Sen. Alan Simpson of Wyoming, a key architect of the popular bill, said in a Senate speech, &quot;I can't imagine anything more cynical than not ... working for its passage on the basis that it is simply going to help the incumbent.&quot;</p>
<p>Simpson said he had &quot;very disappointing signals from the Dole camp&quot; and the presidential candidate was being &quot;ill served&quot; on the immigration issue.</p>
<p>The fate of the immigration legislation, adopted overwhelmingly by the House and Senate earlier this year, hinges on a controversial provision allowing states to deny public education to illegal immigrant children.</p>
<p>Dole is backing the provision, attached to the bill by Representative Elton Gallegly, R-Calif., even though it threatens to derail the bill in the Senate or lead to a presidential veto.</p>
<p>A Dole campaign spokeswoman, Christina Martin, said that campaign leaders made clear at a meeting with key members of Congress last week &quot;that Bob Dole believes immigration reform is a top priority. However, it must include the Gallegly legislation which gives states the option of educatiing illegal children.&quot;</p>
<p>Asked about the possibility that support of the schools provision could sink the bill, Martin said, &quot;that is a legislative matter to be addressed by those who currently hold seats in Congress.&quot;</p>
<p>Because of the Gallegly provision, the bill faces a filibuster in the Senate. Clinton has threatened a veto if it reaches the White House.</p>
<p>Either way, Clinton would be denied the opportunity to sign a popular bill with a flourish thereby taking much of the credit.</p>
<p>Simpson quoted media reports that Dole was being advised to take this course.</p>
<p>&quot;I read that he is being advised ... simply to let the bill die ... so that the president will not have a Rose Garden ceremony with regard to illegal immigration,&quot; Simpson, a former deputy to Senate majority leader Dole, said.</p>
<p>But Simpson called it &quot;childish logic&quot; to believe that Republicans would be able to blame Senate Democrats if the bill died in a filibuster, saying that 10 or 12 Republicans opposed to the Gallegly amendment would help block the bill.</p>
<p>Disagreements between Republicans over the Gallegly provision held up the legislation for months after the Senate followed the House in May in approving legislation seeking to clamp down on illegal immigration.</p>
<p>Republicans eventually modified the provision so that illegal immigrant children currently in school could remain there. States would be able to charge fees if the children changed schools. Further, the law would require a new vote by Congress to continue it in effect beyond 2-1/2 years.</p>
<p>Simpson said he supported the modified provision. It is part of a Republican-drafted compromise bill expected to go before a House-Senate conference committee on Tuesday.</p>
