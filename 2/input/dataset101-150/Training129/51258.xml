<p>Czech police on Friday charged five executives of the failed bank Kreditni Banka a.s. in a fraud scheme which caused losses totalling at least 2.8 billion crowns ($105.5 million), the Czech agency CTK said, quoting a state prosecutor.</p>
<p>The executives, who were not named were detained and charged on Friday. The bank's licence was withdrawn by the Czech National Bank in August with losses estimated at nearly 12 billion crowns.  </p>

<p>The failure of Kreditni Banka, a medium-sized bank based in the western city of Plzen, caused a political furore over bank supervision, and led the government to create a special commission of ministers to investigate the case.</p>
<p>The agency quoted Plzen regional prosecutor Augustin Hrboticky as saying that the executives were charged with fraud, damage to creditors and abetting fraud.</p>
<p>He was quoted as saying investigators had identified accounts to which the 2.88 billion crowns in embezzled funds had been assigned.</p>
<p>No further details were immediately available.</p>
