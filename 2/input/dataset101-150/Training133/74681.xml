<headline>U.S. biotech group rises on flurry of news.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-09-25</dateline>
<text>
<p>U.S. biotechnology shares posted a solid rally on Wednesday after a flurry of positive news in the sector reignited investor interest in the group.</p>
<p>Biotech shares, in a downturn for much of the past summer, got a boost from news out of companies including Genetics Institute Inc, Protein Design Labs Inc and SEQUUS Pharmaceuticals Inc.</p>
<p>&quot;You've got sort of a harmonic convergence of events,&quot; said Michael King a biotech analyst at Vector Securities.</p>
<p>Among chief beneficiaries of the rally was Cephalon Inc, up 2-5/16, or over 13 percent, at 19-3/4.  </p>
<p>A spokeswoman at Cephalon said the company had issued no news that would affect the company's stock.  She cited the general upturn in the biotech group.</p>
<p>The American Stock Exchange's biotech index was up six points, or about four percent, at 135 in late afternoon trading.</p>
<p>Group bellwether Amgen Inc gained 1-1/8 to 63, Chiron Corp was up 3/8 to 19-1/8 and Biogen Inc added 1/2 to 19-1/4.  </p>
<p>Genetics Institute added two to 66-5/8 after it signed Chiron and Genentech Inc as partners in Genetics Institute's protein discovery program.</p>
<p>Protein Design Labs surged 8-3/4 to 24-1/2. It and Roche Holding Ltd said their Zenepax drug was successful in preventing kidney transplant rejection in a late-stage trial, which will lead to filings for U.S., Canadian and European marketing approval.</p>
<p>SEQUUS signed a marketing and distribution pact for its Caelyx anti-cancer drug with Schering-Plough Corp. Its shares, however were off 1-1/8 to 16 after rising one on Tuesday.</p>
<p>King said institutional investor funds appeared to be returning into healthcare stocks.</p>
<p>&quot;The money is flowing into biotechs when it had been flowing out not too long ago,&quot; he said.</p>
