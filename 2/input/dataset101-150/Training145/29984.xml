<title>NORWAY: Norway monitors Bulgaria hijack situation.</title>
<headline>Norway monitors Bulgaria hijack situation.</headline>
<dateline>OSLO 1996-09-03</dateline>

<p>Norway said on Tuesday it was closely following the situation at Varna airport in Bulgaria where a hijacker wanted to be flown to Oslo.</p>
<p>&quot;We are watching this,&quot; a spokeswoman for the Justice Ministry said. &quot;The Justice Ministry's political department and the police have been alerted. We are waiting for more information.&quot;</p>
<p>In Varna, an airport official said a chartered plane of the private Bulgarian Hemus Air company on a flight from Beirut to Varna had been hijacked 15 minutes before landing.</p>
<p>All 150 passengers on board had been freed, but crew members were kept aboard, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The plane, which landed for refuelling, will take off for Oslo shortly,&quot; a Varna airport traffic controller said.</p>
<p>Norway has taken a tough line on hijackers in the past.</p>
<p>In January 1995 Norway extradited three Iranian hijackers to Russia 16 months after they commandeered an Aeroflot airliner on a domestic flight to Oslo.</p>
<p>Last November, a Palestinian woman involved in the 1977 hijacking of a Lufthansa airliner to Mogadishu was put on a plane to Germany after the government rejected her final appeal.</p>
<p>Souhaila Andrawes is on trial in Hamburg charged with murder, attempted murder, hijacking, kidnapping and hostage-taking.</p>
