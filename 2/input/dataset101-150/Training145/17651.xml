<p>Small groups of people were allowed to leave a Sudan Airways plane hijacked to London's Stansted airport on Tuesday with 199 passengers and crew on board.</p>
<p>Reporters saw at least 12 people, mostly women and children, descend the steps of the Airbus 310 just before 6.30 a.m. (0530 GMT), two hours after it arrived from Cyprus.</p>
<p>One woman appeared to collapse in the aircraft doorway before picking herself up and walking down the steps. Two elderly passengers were helped down the steps by a crew member.</p>
<p>A police spokeswoman said two groups of about 10 people had been allowed to leave the plane, including two who were ill.</p>
<p>The plane was hijacked on Monday evening soon after it left Khartoum for the Jordanian capital Amman. Hijackers said they had explosive on board and threatened to blow up the aircraft.</p>
<p>The unidentified hijackers earlier told police in Cyprus they would release the passengers once they landed in London. They said they wanted to claim political asylum in Britain.</p>
<p>British police said the hijackers had, however, issued just one demand -- that they be allowed to speak to an unidentified fellow countryman based in London.</p>
<p>&quot;The only demand that they have made so far is to speak to this fellow countryman,&quot; said Kim White, a spokeswoman for Essex police, the force with responsibility for Stansted. &quot;My understanding is that they actually have their whole familes on board.&quot;</p>
<p>Specially trained British negotiators established telephone contact via the airliner's captain with the unidentified hijackers within an hour of the aircraft touching down.</p>
<p>The plane was parked at a remote part of the airport two miles (three km) from the main terminal.</p>
<p>White said that most of the passengers were Sudanese but that there were also an unknown number of Iraqis, Jordanians, Palestinians, Syrians and Saudis.</p>
<p>Police in Cyprus, where the plane took on fuel, said earlier that at least one of the hijackers was apparently armed with grenades and TNT and had threatened to blow the aircraft up unless it flew to Britain so they could claim political asylum.</p>
