<p>No explosives were found on a Turkish airliner bound from Vienna to Istanbul, which landed at Sofia airport on Wednesday after receiving a bomb threat, an airport official said.</p>
<p>&quot;The plane is now refueling and will take off for Istanbul at around 2000 (1700 GMT),&quot; Sofia airport director Danyo Adanev told reporters.</p>
<p>Airbus 310 was flying from Vienna to Istanbul with 39 passengers on board and landed at Sofia at 1503 (1203 GMT) after traffic controllers in Sofia received a telephone call from Vienna saying there was an explosive on board.</p>
<p>After checking the plane and the passengers for explosives Bulgarian authorites found one piece of unclaimed luggage. </p>
<p>The check showed it contained computer and bicycle parts, police said.</p>
<p>The passengers which included 23 Turks of which four were deported by Austrian authorities, seven Kuwaitis, seven Austrians and two Japanese were scanned individually with their luggage for three hours.</p>
<p>A dozen local journalists and photographers were arrested for going through a security barrier at the airport to try to get a better view of the plane.</p>
<p>In March, a Turkish Cypriot airliner hijacked on a flight from northern Cyprus to Istanbul landed in Sofia airport to refuel before flying to Munich, where the hijacker was arrested.</p>
