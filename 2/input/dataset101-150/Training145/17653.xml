<p>A Sudan Airways plane with 199 passengers and crew on board landed in London early on Tuesday after being seized by hijackers who were reported to want political asylum in Britain.</p>
<p>Reporters saw the Airbus 310 Flight 150, which was hijacked on Monday evening on its way from Khartoum to the Jordanian capital Amman, land at Stansted airport at 4.30 a.m. (0330 GMT) after a flight of more than four hours.</p>
<p>Police in Cyprus, where the plane took on fuel, said earlier that at least one of the unidentified hijackers was apparently armed with grenades and TNT and had threatened to blow the aircraft up unless it was refuelled so they could fly to Britain to claim political asylum.</p>
<p>&quot;They will surrender the passengers there and surrender themselves,&quot; police spokesman Glafcos Xenos told reporters at Larnaca airport.</p>
<p>Security was tight at Stansted airport, London's third-biggest airport, which is about 30 miles (48 km) northeast of the capital.</p>
<p>Stansted has been designated the preferred option for handling hijackings in southern England because it is more remote than Heathrow and Gatwick, London's two major airports, and handles less air traffic.</p>
<p>The identity, number and motives of the hijackers were not immediately known.</p>
<p>Sudan's Islamist military government, which the United States has accused of sponsoring &quot;state terrorism&quot;, has a broad array of political opponents and is waging a bitter war against separatist rebels in the mainly Christian and animist south.</p>
<p>Earlier, Cypriot authorities tried to negotiate through the pilot with one of the hijackers, asking him to release all women and children on board before refuelling.</p>
<p>But he refused and was quoted as saying: &quot;I will blow the plane up.&quot;</p>
<p>One of the hijackers negotiated through the pilot in English. The pilot said several hijackers appeared to be placed around the plane.</p>
<p>The Cypriot police spokesman defended the decision by Cypriot authorities to refuel the plane and let it fly to London, saying they could not risk the lives of those on board.</p>
<p>&quot;They ordered us to refuel the plane, otherwise they were going to blow it up...They had hand grenades,&quot; Xenos said.</p>
<p>&quot;All possible measures were taken but the hijackers refused to negotiate. We tried our best,&quot; Xenos said.</p>
<p>Cyprus initially refused permission for the plane to land but let it touch down when the pilot said he was running out of fuel. Egypt had earlier stopped it from landing, Cypriot officials said. They sent a message to Khartoum asking for a passenger list but got no reply, police said.</p>
<p>The plane was believed to have 186 passengers and 13 crew on board. There were no reports of injuries, Xenos said.</p>
<p>It was the second hijacking this year involving a Sudanese airliner.</p>
<p>On March 24, a Sudan Airways Airbus A320 plane carrying 40 passengers and crew on an internal flight was hijacked to Asmara, the Eritrean capital, where the two Sudanese hijackers surrendered and sought political asylum.</p>
