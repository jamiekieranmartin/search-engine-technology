<headline>African stowaway on Lufthansa flight found dead.</headline>
<dateline>FRANKFURT 1996-09-10</dateline>

<p>A man believed to be from Ghana died at the weekend of suffocation after he climbed into an unpressurised hold of a Lufthansa aircraft bound for Frankfurt during a stop in Accra, the airline said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The man, who was blind and believed to be in his 20s, climbed into the landing gear compartment of the Airbus A300-600 on Sunday night during the interim stop of the flight from Lagos, Nigeria to Frankfurt, the airline said.</p>
<p>Airline workers discovered the body during a routine inspection of the aircraft after the flight arrived on Monday morning in Frankfurt.</p>
<p>The flight's pilots told authorities that they had checked the plane during the stop in Accra, the Ghanaian capital, and had not seen the man, leading the airline to suspect the man climbed into the hold shortly before the flight departed.</p>
<p>The Lufthansa spokesman said the man, who was not carrying papers, was not crushed by the aircraft's landing gear but died because the compartment was not pressurised.</p>
<p>The Airbus, which was carrying 198 passengers and crew, was flying at an altitude of about 33,000 feet (10,060 metres), where the outside air temperature would have also fallen steeply.</p>
