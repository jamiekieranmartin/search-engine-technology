<p>A Bulgarian charter plane on a flight from Beirut, hijacked on Tuesday 15 minutes before landing at Varna airport in Bulgaria, is about to take off again for Oslo, an airport official said.</p>
<p>Earlier, the lone hijacker had released all 150 passengers on arrival at Varna but had kept crew members aboard. the official said.</p>
<p>&quot;The plane will continue to Oslo with the hijacker and the eight-member crew on board,&quot; Varna airport director Atanas Atanasov told reporters.</p>
<p>In the Norwegian capital, a spokeswoman for the Justice Ministry said Norway was closely following the situation.</p>
<p>&quot;The Justice Ministry's political department and the police have been alerted. We are waiting for more information,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>The hijacker's identity was unknown. He was refusing to negotiate directly with the airport authorities and communicated only through the plane's chief pilot, was an Arab and spoke broken English, said Atanasov, quoting the pilot.</p>
<p>He said the hijacker had entered the pilot's cabin carrying a bomb as the plane prepared to land, and demanded to have the plane refuelled and flown either to Oslo or Helsinki. &quot;The plane's transit to Oslo has been cleared,&quot; said Atanasov.</p>
<p>All flights to Varna, near the Black Sea, were cancelled for the time being.</p>
<p>Last week a Turkish airliner bound from Vienna to Istanbul, landed at Sofia airport after receiving a bomb threat. In March a Turkish Cypriot airliner hijacked on a flight from nothern Cyprus to Istanbul landed in Sofia to refuel before flying to Munich, where the hijacker was arrested.</p>
