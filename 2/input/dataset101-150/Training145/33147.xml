<p>A Palestinian who hijacked a Bulgarian charter plane to Oslo to seek political asylum was remanded in custody by a Norwegian court on Wednesday.</p>
<p>His lawyer said the man wanted to live in Norway because it was so peaceful compared to the Middle East. Norwegian officials doubted, however, that he would get his wish given Norway's strict policy on air pirates.</p>
<p>Tuesday's hijacking was the third to end in Norway since the Scandinavian state helped to broker the landmark 1993 Israel-PLO peace pact, leading some experts to suggest Oslo's profile as a peacemaker had made it an attractive destination for hijackers.</p>
<p>The justice ministry said it was not clear if Bulgaria would ask for the extradition of the 23-year-old Palestinian, who was remanded in custody for eight weeks. If not, he will be tried in Norway, where he faces up to 21 years in prison.</p>
<p>&quot;Our position is clear,&quot; justice ministry state secretary Oeystein Maaland told NTB news agency. &quot;We will do everything to fight international terrorism and we will never condone such a serious crime as hijacking.&quot;</p>
<p>The man commandeered the Tupolev TU-154 on a flight from Beirut to Varna airport near Bulgaria's Black Sea coast. He released all 150 passengers before ordering the crew of eight to take off on the flight to Oslo's Gardermoen airport.</p>
<p>Shortly after the plane landed, the man gave himself up. No one was hurt and a bomb with which he had threatened the crew turned out to be a fake. Police have refused to identify the hijacker, in keeping with Norwegian legal practice.</p>
<p>Bulgarian officials had earlier named him as Nadir Abdulah, but he introduced himself to Norwegian police as Nazem Abdulah, according to a transcript of the radio conversation during the brief standoff published by daily VG.</p>
<p>&quot;He has declared he wants to live in peace in Norway and not at war in his own country,&quot; lawyer Jan Schjatvedt told reporters. &quot;He wants to gain political asylum in Norway because he regards Norway as a peaceful country.&quot;</p>
<p>Norway's secret mediation between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation -- the so-called Oslo channel -- put Norway at the centre stage of international diplomacy.</p>
<p>&quot;The Oslo channel made people aware of what Norway stands for,&quot; said Kari Karame, a researcher at the Norwegian Institute for International Affairs (NUPI).</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe hijackers feel that Norway is a country that should do something for them because it advocates human rights so much,&quot; she told Reuters. &quot;They know they get good treatment while they are here.&quot;</p>
<p>Three Iranians commandeered a Russian Aeroflot airliner on a domestic flight to Oslo in September 1993 -- after Norway's role in the Middle East peace process became known -- to protest against human rights abuses in Iran. They were sent back to Russia 16 months later.</p>
<p>A Bosnian Moslem hijacked a domestic Norwegian flight in November 1994 to Oslo in a bid to seek more international aid for his war-ravaged country. He was later sentenced to four years in prison by an Oslo court.</p>
<p>The only previous hijacking involving the normally quiet Scandinavian state was in 1985, when a drunken Norwegian brandishing an air pistol hijacked a domestic flight only to give himself up in return for a six-pack of cold beer. He was jailed for three years.</p>
