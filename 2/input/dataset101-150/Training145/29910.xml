<p>A Palestinian hijacker surrendered at Oslo's Gardermoen airport in less than an hour and requested political asylum after commandeering a Bulgarian charter plane to Norway on Tuesday.</p>
<p>But Norwegian officials doubted that the hijacker, who was to be remanded in custody on Wednesday, would be granted asylum given Norway's strict policy on air pirates.</p>
<p>The man commandeered the Tupolev TU-154 plane on a flight from Beirut to Varna airport near Bulgaria's Black Sea coast and released all 150 passengers before ordering the crew of eight to take off on the three-hour flight to Oslo.</p>
<p>About 45 minutes after the plane touched down at the cordoned-off airport, the man stepped down the gangway, gave himself up and was driven off to jail. No one was hurt.</p>
<p>&quot;He has not given any political motive,&quot; police superintendent Asbjoern Gran told reporters. &quot;The only demands he put forth were to obtain a lawyer, which is easy to fulfil, and to gain political asylum. Maybe all he wanted was to get here. The crew is fine.&quot;</p>
<p>In keeping with Norwegian legal practice, Gran refused to identify the hijacker, but Bulgarian officials earlier named him as Nadir Abdulah. &quot;He is of Palestinian origin and between 20 and 30 years old,&quot; Gran said. &quot;He speaks broken English.&quot;</p>
<p>The hijacker earlier threatened the crew with a bomb, but in Oslo he told police he had no weapon at all. A search of the plane yielded what appeared to be a make-believe bomb, Gran told the national news agency NTB.</p>
<p>It was not know why the Palestinian was seeking asylum in Norway, but the Scandinavian country is involved in promoting the Middle East peace process, having helped to broker the landmark 1993 Israel-PLO peace pact.</p>
<p>Justice Minister Grete Faremo, who has deported four hijackers from Norway in a year and a half, said she was happy that the drama had ended peacefully but did not comment on the Palestinian's request for asylum.</p>
<p>But a justice ministry official, asked by NTB if the hijacker would gain asylum, said: &quot;I doubt that very much.&quot;</p>
<p>Carl Hagen, leader of the opposition right-wing Progress Party, was blunter, saying: &quot;He should be sent back on the same flight, in handcuffs.&quot;</p>
<p>Varna airport director Atanas Atanasov earlier said the hijacker entered the crew cabin with a bomb in his hand 15 minutes before landing at Varna and demanded that the flight continue either to Helsinki or to Oslo.</p>
<p>One of the passengers said at Varna: &quot;The man had most of his face veiled with a handkerchief and refused to take food or drink during the flight. Before touch-down he became nervous.&quot;</p>
<p>In January 1995, Norway sent back three Iranian hijackers to Russia 16 months after they commandeered an Aeroflot airliner on a domestic flight to Oslo.</p>
<p>Last November, Palestinian woman Souhaila Andrawes, who had been living secretly in Oslo with her daughter and husband, was extradited to Germany for her role in the 1977 hijacking of a Lufthansa airliner to Mogadishu. She is on trial in Hamburg.</p>
