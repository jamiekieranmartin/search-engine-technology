<p>A fire broke out in the tail of a Continental Airlines plane at La Guardia airport on Thursday, forcing passengers to evacuate by chute onto the runway, officials said.</p>
<p>Six passengers on Cleveland-bound Flight 1993 were injured, a spokeswoman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which manages the region's major airports, said. All the injuries were minor and occurred during evacuation.</p>
<p>&quot;There was a fire in the tail cone that was quickly extinguished by the Port Authority police rescue team,&quot; spokeswoman Gwen Williams said. &quot;The fire broke out while the aircraft was on the taxiway at 9:42 this morning, it hadn't taken off.&quot;</p>
<p>Continental Airlines said the pilot also activated the fire extinguishers on both engines of the MD-80 plane.</p>
<p>Airline spokeswoman Sarah Anthony said the fire began after a &quot;false start&quot; in the no. 2 engine that was similar to a car backfiring. She said the 89 passengers and 5 crew were evacuated on two chutes and were being accommodated on other flights.</p>
<p>In an incident Thursday at Stewart International Airport in Newburgh, New York, officials said a DC-10 plane owned by FedEx Corporation was engulfed by flames after making an emergency landing. The three people on board were unharmed.</p>
