<p>The hijacker who seized a Bulgarian charter plane on a flight from Beirut to Varna on Tuesday and took off again for Oslo after freeing the 150 passengers was a Palestinian, airport official said.</p>
<p>&quot;The hijacker is Palestinian and his name is Nadir Abdulah,&quot; a Varna Airport official told reporters. He is around 35 years old and six feet high, the official added.</p>
<p>Abdulah, who seized the TU-150 aircraft 15 minutes before it touched down in Varna, near Bulgaria's Black Sea coast, freed the passengers at the airport but kept the eight crew aboard and demanded refueling.</p>
<p>The plane took off for Oslo at 1810 (1510 GMT).</p>
<p>&quot;The man (Abdulah) had most of his face veiled with a handkerchief and refused to take food or drink during the flight. Before touch down he became nervous,&quot; said one of the passengers.</p>
<p>&quot;The hijacker entered the crew cabin with a bomb in hand 15 minutes before landing and demanded to continue the flight either to Helsinki or to Oslo,&quot; Varna airport director Atanas Atanasov told reporters.</p>
<p>&quot;The pilot convinced him that the plane needed refuelling and a cleared passage to the final destination,&quot; said Atanasov.</p>
<p>The hijacker refused to negotiate directly with airport authorities and communicated only through the plane's captain, who at the time described him as an Arab speaking broken English, Atanasov said.</p>
<p>In Oslo, a spokeswoman for the justice ministry said the ministry's political department and the police had been alerted.</p>
<p>The Norwegian news agency NTB quoted an aviation official as saying the plane was expected to reach Oslo at 1800 GMT.</p>
<p>When the flight left Varna, flights to and from the city resumed after being suspended for three hours.</p>
<p>Bulgaria has been involved in two recent incidents of threats to airliners.</p>
<p>Last week a Turkish plane bound from Vienna to Istanbul landed at Sofia airport after receiving a bomb threat. In March a Turkish Cypriot airliner, hijacked on a flight from northern Cyprus to Istanbul, landed in Sofia to refuel before flying to Munich, where the hijacker was arrested.</p>
