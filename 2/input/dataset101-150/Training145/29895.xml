<p>A Bulgarian charter plane hijacked on a flight from Beirut to Bulgaria by a Palestinian brandishing a bomb landed in the Norwegian capital on Tuesday amid tight security.</p>
<p>The plane, flying in from Bulgaria's Varna airport, touched down at the closed-off Gardermoen airport in the evening with rows of ambulances, fire engines and police waiting.</p>
<p>The plane was commandeered on a flight from Beirut to Varna airport near Bulgaria's Black Sea coast earlier on Tuesday. The hijacker released all 150 passengers at Varna before ordering the crew of eight to take off on the three-hour flight to Oslo.</p>
<p>Police wearing bullet-proof vests guarded the section at the end of the runway where the TU-154 airliner was parked outside the view of reporters.</p>
<p>&quot;We have no comment or insight into the situation,&quot; an official for the aviation authority said. &quot;We have got nothing to say.&quot;</p>
<p>Varna airport director Atanas Atanasov earlier said the hijacker entered the crew cabin with a bomb in his hand 15 minutes before landing and demanded to continue the flight either to Helsinki or to Oslo.</p>
<p>An airport official said the hijacker was a Palestinian named Nadir Abdulah in his mid-30s and six feet high.</p>
<p>The hijacker's motives were unclear, but Norway is a key player in promoting the Middle East peace process, having helped to broker the landmark 1993 Israel-PLO peace pact.</p>
<p>Atanasov said the hijacker refused to negotiate directly with airport authorities and communicated only through the plane's captain, who described him as an Arab speaking broken English.</p>
<p>&quot;The pilot convinced him that the plane needed refuelling and a cleared passage to the final destination,&quot; said Atanasov.</p>
<p>One of the passengers said: &quot;The man had most of his face veiled with a handkerchief and refused to take food or drink during the flight. Before touch down he became nervous.&quot;</p>
<p>Norway has taken a tough line on hijackers in the past.</p>
<p>In January 1995 Norway extradited three Iranian hijackers to Russia 16 months after they commandeered an Aeroflot airliner on a domestic flight to Oslo.</p>
<p>Last November, a Palestinian woman involved in the 1977 hijacking of a Lufthansa airliner to Mogadishu was put on a plane to Germany after the government rejected her final appeal.</p>
<p>Souhaila Andrawes is on trial in Hamburg charged with murder, attempted murder, hijacking, kidnapping and hostage-taking.</p>
<p>Bulgaria has been involved in two recent incidents of threats to airliners.</p>
<p>Last week a Turkish plane bound from Vienna to Istanbul landed at Sofia airport after receiving a bomb threat. In March a Turkish Cypriot airliner, hijacked on a flight from northern Cyprus to Istanbul, landed in Sofia to refuel before flying to Munich, where the hijacker was arrested.</p>
