<p>An unclaimed package was found on a Turkish airliner bound from Vienna to Istanbul, which landed at Sofia airport on Wednesday after receiving a bomb threat, an airport official said.</p>
<p>&quot;One piece of luggage was found which none of the passengers acknowledged,&quot; Sofia airport general director Danyo Adanev told reporters.</p>
<p>He said the Airbus 310 was flying from Vienna to Istanbul with 39 passengers on board and landed at Sofia at 1503 (1203 GMT) after traffic controllers in Sofia received a telephone call from Vienna saying there was an explosive on board.</p>
<p>The plane was surrounded by 11 fire engines after landing, and was being checked for explosives. The passengers and the luggage were being scanned individually.</p>
<p>The unclaimed piece of baggage was being checked for explosives, said Adanev.</p>
<p>The airliner was expected to continue its flight for Istanbul after the check was completed.</p>
<p>&quot;We must ensure the plane is clean,&quot; said Adanev.</p>
<p>A dozen local journalists and photographers were arrested for going through a security barrier at the airport to try to get a better view of the plane.</p>
<p>In March, a Turkish Cypriot airliner hijacked on a flight from northern Cyprus to Istanbul landed in Sofia airport to refuel before flying to Munich, where the hijacker was arrested.</p>
