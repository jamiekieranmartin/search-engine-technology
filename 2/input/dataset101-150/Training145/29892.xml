<p>A Palestinian who hijacked a Bulgarian charter airliner to Norway on Tuesday surrendered quickly at Oslo's Gardermoen airport and asked for a lawyer and political asylum, police said.</p>
<p>The man commandeered the Tupolev TU-154 plane on a flight from Beirut to Varna airport near Bulgaria's Black Sea coast and released all 150 passengers in Varna before ordering the crew of eight to take off on the three-hour flight to Oslo.</p>
<p>About 45 minutes after the plane touched down at the cordoned-off airport, the man stepped down the gangway, gave himself up and was driven off to jail. No one was hurt.</p>
<p>&quot;The man surrendered at 8.47 p.m. (1847 GMT),&quot; police superintendent Asbjoern Gran told reporters. &quot;He asked for a lawyer. He asked for political asylum. He said there is no weapon on board but we will check for ourselves.&quot;</p>
<p>He added that the man would be remanded in custody on Wednesday.</p>
<p>It was not know why the hijacker was seeking asylum in Norway, but the Scandinavian country is a key player in promoting the Middle East peace process, having helped to broker the landmark 1993 Israel-PLO peace pact.</p>
<p>There was no immediate comment from the government on whether the Palestinian would obtain asylum. However, Norway has taken a tough line on hijackers in the past, extradicting them soon after arrival.</p>
<p>&quot;He has not given any political motive,&quot; Gran said. &quot;Maybe all he wanted was to get here. He is of Palestinian origin and between 20 and 30 years old. He speaks broken English.&quot;</p>
<p>Varna airport director Atanas Atanasov earlier said the hijacker entered the crew cabin with a bomb in his hand 15 minutes before landing at Varna and demanded that the flight continue either to Helsinki or to Oslo. Bulgarian officials identified him as Nadir Abdulah.</p>
<p>One of the passengers said at Varna: &quot;The man had most of his face veiled with a handkerchief and refused to take food or drink during the flight. Before touch-down he became nervous.&quot;</p>
<p>In January 1995 Norway extradited three Iranian hijackers to Russia 16 months after they commandeered an Aeroflot airliner on a domestic flight to Oslo.</p>
<p>Last November, a Palestinian woman involved in the 1977 hijacking of a Lufthansa airliner to Mogadishu was put on a plane to Germany after the government rejected her final appeal. Souhaila Andrawes is on trial in Hamburg charged with murder, attempted murder, hijacking, kidnapping and hostage-taking.</p>
<p>Bulgaria has been involved in two recent incidents of threats to airliners. Last week a Turkish plane bound from Vienna to Istanbul landed at Sofia airport after receiving a bomb threat. In March a Turkish Cypriot airliner, hijacked on a flight from northern Cyprus to Istanbul, landed in Sofia to refuel before flying to Munich, where the hijacker was arrested.</p>
