<title>UK: Airline pilot &quot;scared of heights&quot;.</title>

<p>An airliner flying 49 passengers from Britain to Italy had to divert to a French airport after the co-pilot told the pilot he was &quot;frightened of the altitude&quot;, an official accident report said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The co-pilot had said he felt unwell as the Maersk Air Ltd BAC 1-11 flight flew over Moulins, France, to Milan.</p>
<p>As the co-pilot continued &quot;to show symptoms of anxiety and stress&quot;, the pilot asked for permission to land at Lyon, said the report from the Air Accidents Investigation Branch.</p>
<p>The co-pilot's condition later improved and he was able to help the pilot as the plane landed safely.</p>
<p>But he was suspended from duty, subsequently failed the required medical tests and later left the airline, said a spokeswoman for Maersk, a British Airways franchise operator owned by Norwegian company Maersk Air.</p>
<p>The incident happened on May 9, just under a year after the co-pilot joined Maersk, having worked as a commercial pilot for two other airlines since 1989.</p>
<p>&quot;The co-pilot had been with us for just under a year and there had been no problem before,&quot; Maersk spokeswoman Roseanne Crossey said. &quot;I don't believe he is flying any more and I'm not sure what work he is now involved in.&quot;</p>
