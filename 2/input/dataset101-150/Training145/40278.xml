<title>USA: Airlines raise domestic fares 2.5 percent.</title>

<p>Strong demand for air travel led to a 2.5 percent increase in air fares by most major airlines over the weekend, matching an increase initiated by Continental Airlines Inc. last week.</p>
<p>&quot;We've seen a tremendous demand this summer and our advanced bookings for the fall are looking strong,&quot; said Jackie Pate, a spokeswoman for Delta Air Lines Inc.</p>
<p>The fare hikes come on top of the 10 percent federal passenger excise tax reinstated in August, which had prompted some airlines to increase their fares 10 percent.</p>
<p>The lone exception was Southwest Airlines Co.</p>
<p>&quot;It was just a business decision.  We are the low-fare airline,&quot; said Southwest spokeswoman Linda Rutherford.</p>
<p>In August some airlines raised their fares by 10 percent to cover the excise tax, but the fare hike did not stick because it was not uniformly matched by all carriers.</p>
<p>Airlines that said they raised their fares over the weekend are Trans World Airlines Inc., United Airlines, Northwest Airlines Corp. and USAir Group Inc.</p>
<p>The airlines also cited rising fuel costs and the expense of increased security as reasons for the fare hike.</p>
<p>They said the fare increase applied to domestic flights on most routes that do not compete with Southwest Airlines.</p>
<p>Southwest said it absorbed the cost of the excise tax on most of its routes, except for longer flights, and has so far chosen not to make additional fare increases.</p>
<p>&quot;We know that the resumption of the (excise) tax will definitely impact profits, but we don't know by how much yet,&quot; Rutherford added.</p>
