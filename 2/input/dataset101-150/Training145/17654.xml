<p>A hijacked Sudan Airways plane with 199 passengers and crew on board headed early on Tuesday for London on the orders of armed hijackers who were reported to want political asylum in Britain.</p>
<p>The Airbus 310 Flight 150 was hijacked on its way from Khartoum to the Jordanian capital Amman on Monday evening and landed at Larnaca airport in Cyprus to refuel.</p>
<p>One hijacker was apparently armed with grenades and TNT and threatened to blow the plane up unless it was refuelled and they were taken to London so they could claim political asylum.</p>
<p>&quot;They will surrender the passengers there and surrender themselves,&quot; police spokesman Glafcos Xenos told reporters at Larnaca airport.</p>
<p>The identity, number and motives of the hijackers were not immediately known.</p>
<p>Sudan's Islamist military government, which the United States has accused of sponsoring &quot;state terrorism&quot;, has a broad array of political opponents and is waging a bitter war against separatist rebels in the mainly Christian and animist south.</p>
<p>The plane was expected to land at Stansted, London's third airport 30 miles (50 km) northeast of the capital, at about 4 a.m. (0300 GMT).</p>
<p>&quot;That is the plan at the moment. That is where the plane is being directed to,&quot; Ruth Collin of Essex police, the force responsible for Stansted, said.</p>
<p>British officials said they would much prefer to deal with a hijacking at Stansted because of its relatively remote location and because air traffic would be less badly disrupted there than at Heathrow or Gatwick airports.</p>
<p>They said police and emergency services were implementing a well-rehearsed contingency plan to handle the hijacking.</p>
<p>Earlier, Cypriot authorities tried to negotiate through the pilot with one of the hijackers, asking him to release all women and children on board before refuelling.</p>
<p>But he refused and was quoted as saying: &quot;I will blow the plane up.&quot;</p>
<p>One of the hijackers negotiated through the pilot in English. The pilot said several hijackers appeared to be placed around the plane.</p>
<p>The Cypriot police spokesman defended the decision by Cypriot authorities to refuel the plane and let it fly to London, saying they could not risk the lives of those on board.</p>
<p>&quot;They ordered us to refuel the plane, otherwise they were going to blow it up...They had hand grenades,&quot; Xenos said.</p>
<p>&quot;All possible measures were taken but the hijackers refused to negotiate. We tried our best,&quot; Xenos said.</p>
<p>Cyprus initially refused permission for the plane to land but let it touch down when the pilot said he was running out of fuel. Egypt had earlier stopped it from landing, Cypriot officials said. They sent a message to Khartoum asking for a passenger list but got no reply, police said.</p>
<p>The plane was believed to have 186 passengers and 13 crew on board. There were no reports of injuries, Xenos said.</p>
<p>It was the second hijacking this year involving a Sudanese airliner.</p>
<p>On March 24, a Sudan Airways Airbus A320 plane carrying 40 passengers and crew on an internal flight was hijacked to Asmara, the Eritrean capital, where the two Sudanese hijackers surrendered and sought political asylum.</p>
