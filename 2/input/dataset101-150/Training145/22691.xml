<p>All 141 passengers and crew on board a Russian airliner that crashed on Thursday on the remote Arctic island of Spitzbergen have died, Norwegian officials and the Russian airline said.</p>
<p>&quot;No survivors have been found and our first aid staff are returning from the crash site,&quot; local government official Kjetil Hansen told reporters. The Norwegian news agency NTB quoted a Vnukovo Airlines official as saying no one appeared to have survived the disaster.  </p>
<p>The Vnukovo Airlines Tupolev 154 flight from Moscow, carrying 129 passengers and a crew of 12, crashed in bad weather 10 km (six miles) east of Longyearbyen, the island's only airstrip, officials said.</p>
<p>All passengers on the plane, chartered by the Russian mining company Trust Arktik Ugol, were miners going to work in one of the island's two open cast coal mines, accompanied by their families, Russian officials told the Norwegian news agency.</p>
<p>First rescuers arrived shortly after 1 p.m. (1100 GMT) and reported soon afterwards that most of the three-engine jet's wreckage was scattered around the top of the small Opera mountain while the rest had slid down the mountainside.</p>
<p>Spitzbergen is a Norwegian coal-mining settlement. The only other community is in the Russian village of Barentsburg. Russia and Norway share the island's resources under a treaty dating back to the 1920s.</p>
