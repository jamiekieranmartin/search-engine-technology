<p>A bus struck and ruptured a natural gas line near Washington's National Airport on Friday, forcing the evacuation of hundreds of people and wreaking havoc on air traffic along the U.S. eastern seaboard.</p>
<p>Airport and gas company officials said the main terminal at the city's airport was evacuated around 8:30 p.m. EDT (0030 GMT Saturday) after an airport shuttle bus hit a one-inch (2.5 cm) exposed natural gas pipeline in a traffic tunnel near the airport.</p>
<p>The ruptured line began spewing gas and the fumes could be detected several hundred feet away, a reporter for local FOX Television affiliate WTTG-TV said, adding that at least one woman was taken to a local hospital.</p>
<p>Washington Gas workers capped the leak and turned the gas off around 10 p.m. (0200 GMT), said spokeswoman Lynn Scruggs.</p>
<p>&quot;The situation has been made safe. We'll be making repairs,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Airport spokeswoman Tara Hamilton told WRC-TV the evacuation had affected the main terminal, including the air traffic control tower, but operations had resumed around 11 p.m. EDT (0300 GMT). She also said several flights had been diverted to Dulles International Airport, another airport in the Washington area.</p>
<p>Dozens of passengers evacuated hastily after the accident were still waiting to claim their luggage, nearly two hours after arriving at the airport.</p>
<p>The Friday night incident interrupted or delayed holiday plans for many of the passengers. The Labour Day holiday on Monday is considered the last holiday weekend of the summer.</p>
<p>&quot;Some of the fire people just came out and were waving, come out, there's a gas leak. They just forced us out and now we're waiting for our luggage,&quot; one man told WTTG-TV.</p>
<p>The evacuation also stranded the people aboard at least one United Airlines flight that had already landed at the airport as well as delaying the arrival of many other flights.</p>
<p>No information was immediately available about the exact number of flights affected by the evacuation. Federal Aviation Administration officials referred all queries to the airport, where phones went largely unanswered.</p>
<p>Dave Schultz, pilot of United Airlines Flight 634, landed his plane at the airport around 8:40 p.m.(0040 GMT Saturday), but told passengers they would have to remain on board because he could not reach anyone at the airport to bring the necessary equipment out to allow passengers to disembark.</p>
<p>He told passengers at least one other plane, an Air Canada flight, was circling Baltimore after trying to land at the Washington airport.</p>
<p>&quot;We're making the best out of what is obviously a very bad situation,&quot; Schultz told Reuters.</p>
<p>Passengers on the flight, many of whom were returning from this week's Democratic National Convention in Chicago, were eventually taken by bus to another terminal and told to get their luggage on Saturday.</p>
