<headline>Hijacked Sudanese plane on ground in Cyprus.</headline>
<dateline>LARNACA, Cyprus 1996-08-27</dateline>
<text>
<p>A Sudan Airways Airbus 310 was hijacked between Khartoum and Amman on Monday evening and landed in Cyprus for refuelling, Cypriot air traffic control sources said early on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The sources said the hijackers -- it was not clear how many they were -- wanted to fly to London &quot;for humanitarian reasons&quot; or to seek political asylum in Britain.</p>
<p>The hijackers refused a Cypriot request to allow women and children off the plane before refuelling, one air trafic control source said.</p>
<p>Refuelling had not yet begun, he added.</p>
<p>Michael Herodotou, director of civil aviation authority in Cyprus, said the plane was initially refused permission to land at Larnaca but was allowed to touch down when it was learned it was running out of fuel.</p>
<p>Contact with the hijackers was being made through the pilot. Hospitals in Cyprus were on stand-by and there was tight police security at Larnaca airport.</p>
<p>Cairo airport sources said earlier the plane was hijacked about 20 minutes after it took off from Khartoum airport.</p>
<p>It was the second hijacking this year involving a Sudanese airliner.</p>
<p>On March 24, a Sudan Airways Airbus A320 plane carrying 40 passengers and crew was hijacked to Eritrea.</p>
<p>The two Sudanese hijackers who seized the plane on an internal flight sought political asylum in Eritrea. They surrendered to Eritrean authorities immediately after reaching Asmara, the Eritrean capital.</p>
