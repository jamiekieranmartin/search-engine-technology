<p>A two-day world conference on solar and other renewable energy opened on Monday with speakers pledging support for a global plan to provide energy to all mankind.</p>
<p>Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe appealed at the opening for solid political and financial backing for the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organistion (UNESCO)'s 1996-2005 World Solar Programme which aims to provide energy to 2.4 billion people living without electricity.</p>
<p>U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said the world needed new sources of energy because conventional power sources not only damaged the environment but were inadequate to meet increasing global energy demands.</p>
<p>&quot;It is estimated that global demand for fuel will increase by 30 percent over this period (the next 30 years) while demand for electricity will rise by well over two-and-a-half times,&quot; Boutros-Ghali said in a statement to the meeting held under a scorching sun in Harare.</p>
<p>&quot;Conservation and efficiency measures alone will not be enough to cope with this increase in demand. New sources of energy need to be found, developed and exploited quickly,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said the Harare conference offered real hope of marshalling support to keep development of technology to harness the sun's power and other renewable energy sources high on the international agenda.</p>
<p>Christos Papoutsis, a member of the European Commission in charge of energy policies, urged the 5,000 delegates from 100 countries to mobilise financial resources to make the development and use of renewable energy sources a reality in each of their countries.</p>
<p>&quot;The implementation of hundreds of strategic and priority projects on a global level now has to be our first priority,&quot; he said, in reference to about 300 projects to be launched at the conference under UNESCO's 1996-2005 World Solar Programme.</p>
<p>The projects include desalination of water from the Red Sea for drinking water in Jordan and several schemes to provide remote villages in Africa, Asia and Latin America -- where more than two billion people live without electricity -- solar powered cookers.</p>
<p>&quot;I can assure you that as far as the Commission is concerned, we will do everything to ensure that renewable energy sources are duly considered in all the relevant financial support mechanisms,&quot; Papoutsis said.</p>
<p>On Sunday evening, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad criticised rich Western countries for showing litte interest in the Harare summit, which has attracted only 10 heads of state and governments from an original 25 organisers were expecting.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems from the response to this summit that people with the funds and technology to help are not too keen to participate.&quot; he told reporters.</p>
<p>In his address, Mugabe said international efforts to limit emission of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide that are blamed for changes in the earth's climate would prove difficult given demands by developing countries to increase use of conventional energies.</p>
<p>&quot;Consequently, technological innovation is viewed as one possible route to meet the challenge of continued growth in world energy demand, without adding significantly to the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases,&quot; he said.</p>
