<p>The Clinton administration promised House lawmakers Thursday that it would make no new commitments to curb U.S. carbon emissions before it knows what impact new obligations might have on the economy.</p>
<p>&quot;We will not agree to any specific targets until we've completed the analysis,&quot; Assistant Secretary of State Eileen Claussen said at a packed House energy and power panel hearing on international negotiations to combat global warming.</p>
<p>The administration expects to complete its analysis by the end of this year or early next year, said Under Secretary of Commerce Everett Ehrlich.</p>
<p>Scientists widely believe man-made carbon emissions have a significant impact on the earth's climate and should be cut in order to prevent a range of crises, including massive floods, hurricanes, and the spread of tropical diseases.</p>
<p>Lawmakers, nervous that new environmental measures will hammer U.S. industry, were taken aback when the Clinton administration in July said it would work toward an agreement which included legally binding targets for cutting emissions.</p>
<p>While the administration said emissions should be pared, Claussen agreed with House members that a December 1997 deadline was &quot;ambitious&quot; for reaching a decision that would require industrialized countries to take major steps to meet strict targets and timetables.</p>
<p>The date for an agreement was set by international negotiators seeking to combat global warming beyond 2000.</p>
<p>House members repeated pleas that Washington should not agree to impose tighter requirements on U.S. industry than on competitors in developing countries.</p>
<p>Any agreement imposing different requirements on industrialized and developing countries &quot;would be very poorly received up here,&quot; warned Rep. John Dingell of Michigan, the top Democrat on the House Commerce Committee.</p>
<p>But Claussen said only that the administration would not agree to any measures that forced the United States to cap its emissions at the same level per person as developing countries, where emissions per person are a fraction of the current U.S. level.</p>
<p>&quot;Any future commitment must be predicated on ensuring that the U.S. ecnomy remains robust and internationally competitive,&quot; the administration said in a statement.</p>
