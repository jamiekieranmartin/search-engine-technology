<p>Britain took its first official steps towards costing environmental damage and depletion on Wednesday, releasing national accounts measuring air pollution, spending on environmental protection and oil and gas reserves.</p>
<p>The report, produced by the Office for National Statistics and covering 70 industries, pointed the finger at certain sectors for the bulk of Britain's air pollution problems.</p>
<p>It also showed UK net national income may have been overestimated because the costs of falling oil and gas reserves have not been accounted for to date.</p>
<p>At current rates of extraction, Britain's oil and gas supplies will last only 40 years, the report said.</p>
<p>For 1993, the ONS said pre-tax profits from exploiting oil and gas were 2.2 billion pounds ($3.43 billion) in excess of a &quot;normal state of return&quot;. It said it regarded that as a measure of the cost of depletion of reserves.</p>
<p>So net national income, for that year at least, could be said to have been overstated to the tune of two billion pounds.</p>
<p>But city economists said that will be of little concern to the financial markets.</p>
<p>&quot;The markets are interested in the rate of GDP growth not absolute national income per se,&quot; said John Shepperd, chief economist at Yamaichi International.</p>
<p>The key growth figure for the markets is gross domestic product. Depreciation, be it for oil and gas or any other industry, would only relate to net income figures, not gross.</p>
<p>&quot;We're not heading towards a green GDP figure,&quot; an ONS official said. &quot;What we are producing is a one-year profile of environmental costs over the economy. That hasn't been done before.&quot;</p>
<p>The accounts will be developed further to analyse how economic developments will affect pollution in the future, the ONS said. Next year, for example, the accounts will include a look at radioactive waste and water emissions.</p>
<p>The report also put the spotlight on the electricity generation industry and transport for the bulk of Britain's air pollution problems.</p>
<p>The ONS report said electricity generation produced 25 percent of greenhouse gas and 44 percent of acid rain emissions in 1993.</p>
<p>Transport -- including road haulage, transport used by industry and private transport and road vehicles -- produced 22 percent of greenhouse gases and 30 percent of acid rain in Britain.</p>
<p>The large part of that pollution was not created by the road haulage industry, the ONS said. But a high proportion of black smoke was emitted by heavy goods vehicles, the majority of which are based in road haulage, it said.</p>
<p>But British industries are facing up to some of their environmental responsibilities, the report showed.</p>
<p>Total environmental expenditure by the extraction, manufacturing, energy production and water industries totalled 2.3 billion stg in 1993. The chemicals, paper and publishing and food manufacturing industries spent most on environmental protection. ($1=.6421 Pound)</p>
