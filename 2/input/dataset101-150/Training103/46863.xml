<p>One body was recovered and 13 people were missing after a boat accident in northern India in which 40 people were earlier feared drowned, the Press Trust of India (PTI) said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The news agency quoted a home (interior) department spokesman of the state of Uttar Pradesh as saying that 41 women and children, who were among 55 passengers on a joy ride, swam to their safety or were saved by rescuers.</p>
<p>The accident occurred late on Tuesday on the Rapti river near a village in Bahraich district, some 240 km (160 miles) from Lucknow, the state capital.</p>
<p>Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda expressed grief over the accident, PTI said.</p>
<p>The boat was believed to have been swept away by a swift water current, it said.</p>
<p>Most Indian rivers are overflowing this year after heavy rains in the monsoon season that began in June.</p>
<p>PTI had said earlier that there were 60 passengers travelling on the boat.</p>
