<headline>P&amp;O explores Channel ferry deals - source.</headline>

<p>British transport and construction company Peninsular and Orient Navigation Co (P&amp;O) has begun preliminary discussions on cooperation with its rivals in the ferry business between England and France to counter the impact of Eurotunnel services, a source at the company said on Sunday.</p>
<p>The British government earlier this year decided to remove regulations that prevented collaboration between ferry firms, but industry executives told Reuters last month that they did not expect contacts to begin for a few weeks.  </p>
<p>The Independent on Sunday newspaper said P&amp;O had started negotiations with Sweden's Stena Line AB and with the privately owned Brittanny Ferries and state owned SNAT of France.</p>
<p>A source at P&amp;O said the talks were only preliminary and not substantive.</p>
<p>Passenger car and freight traffic through Eurotunnel's Channel Tunnel, by its own Le Shuttle and railway company-operated Eurostar services, have eaten into the ferry companies' business.</p>
<p>This summer was the first season of full tunnel services, and ferry operators were thought to want to assess the full effects of the increased competition before engaging in talks.</p>
<p>P&amp;O and Stena have in the past signalled they did not see a full merger of their ferry businesses.</p>
