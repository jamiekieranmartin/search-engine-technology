<p>A man armed with a shotgun and grenades seized a passenger aboard a Philippine ferry at sea and escaped with her on a life raft, the coast guard said on Sunday.</p>
<p>Before fleeing, the man demanded 50,000 pesos ($1,925) from the crew and passengers but they could produce only 24,000 pesos ($925), which the man took before escaping with his hostage on Saturday, the coast guard said.</p>
<p>The ferry, identified as the St Francis of Assisi, was following the raft at a distance and reporting its movements to the coast guard by telephone, coast guard commander Ernesto Caballero said.</p>
<p>The coast guard said it did not know how many passengers were on the ferry but radio reports said more than 600 people were aboard.</p>
<p>&quot;We do not want to get close to the life boat because the man might harm his hostage. We do not know how desperate he is,&quot; Caballero said by telephone.</p>
<p>He said the man initially grabbed seven hostages while the ferry was cruising in central Philippine waters but freed six of them and took only one, a woman, with him on the raft.</p>
<p>Caballero said the coast guard did not know what the man's motive and plans were but he was apparently headed towards one of the small islands in the Cuyo island group, 400 km (248.5 miles) south of Manila.</p>
<p>&quot;We have a welcome party there for him in case he makes for land,&quot; Caballero said.</p>
