<p>A man with a shotgun and two grenades seized a passenger aboard a Philippine ferry and escaped with her on a life raft, but surrendered after drifting for nine hours at sea, the coast guard said on Sunday.</p>
<p>Before fleeing, the man had demanded 50,000 pesos ($1,925) from the crew and passengers but they could produce only 24,000 pesos ($925), which the man took before leaving with his hostage on Saturday, the coast guard said.</p>
<p>The ferry tailed the raft for nine hours before the hostage-taker, 21-year-old Rolando Elauria, surrendered on Sunday morning to the ship's captain, coast guard spokesman Commander Ernesto Caballero said.</p>
<p>The ferry, the 5,873-tonne St Francis of Assisi, was carrying about 600 passengers, he said.</p>
<p>Elauria initially grabbed seven hostages while the ferry was cruising in central Philippine waters but freed six of them and took only the woman with him on the raft.</p>
<p>Two of the hostages were injured in the incident.</p>
<p>As the rubber boat drifted towards islands where police were waiting, Elauria signalled to the ferry that he was giving up, Caballero said by telephone.</p>
<p>The ferry sailed up to the raft and took the man and his hostage back on board.</p>
<p>Police were preparing criminal charges against the man, Caballero said. He said he did not know if the man had any other motive besides wanting money.</p>
