<p>A ferry carrying 60 people sank in the Nile in southern Egypt on Thursday and security sources said many were feared drowned.</p>
<p>The ferry, which was carrying a number of people returning home from a funeral, was in collision with a barge.  </p>
<p>Six people swam ashore and others may also have done so, but it was not immediately possible to say because the accident happened after dark, the sources said.</p>
<p>No bodies had been found, they added.</p>
<p>The accident happened near the village of Atnidan in Minya province about 260 km (160 miles) south of Cairo at a point where the Nile is several hundred metres (yards) wide.</p>
