<p>Here is how major stock markets outside the United States ended on Friday.</p>
<p>LONDON - British stocks closed mostly higher on Friday, propelled by strong drug and oil stocks but dragged off the day's highs by a weak Wall Street opening. The FTSE 100 index ended 13.2 points up at 3,946.4 but down 17.7 on the week.</p>
<p>FRANKFURT - Shares closed bourse trade slightly lower on a mild bout of profit-taking following recent moves up towards record-highs but dealers said the underlying market was buoyed by the dollar's strength. The DAX index of Germany's 30 leading shares closed 7.51 points lower at 2,659.04 a gain of 12.94 on the week. In post-bourse trade the index fell 5.10 to 2,659.86.</p>
<p>PARIS - French shares finished firmer but off their best levels as the blue-chip CAC-40 index butted against resistance levels and then fell back. The blue chip CAC-40 index finished up 2.91 points at 2,107.05 a gain of 24.55 on the week.</p>
<p>ZURICH - Swiss shares ended a shade lower after a slow directionless session but dealers expected favourable fundamentals, such as an easier Swiss franc, to lend support to the market in the near-term. The all-share Swiss Performance Index fell 1.58 points to 2,373.07, which was up 4.65 from last Friday.</p>
<p>TOKYO - Stocks eked out only small gains by the end of Friday's session after a three-day winning streak. But brokers said they confirmed the firmness in the market's current trend after stock prices won back their morning losses. The key 225-share Nikkei average rose 85.65 points to close at 21,547.02, up 434.78 from a week ago.</p>
<p>HONG KONG - Stocks rallied to a new 1996 peak and closed at their highest level since February 1994, boosted by futures-led buying ahead of the expiry of September Hang Seng futures this session. The Hang Seng index closed on a gain of 123.26 points at 11,759.39. There was a gain of 167.09 since last Friday.</p>
<p>SYDNEY - The share market closed confidently higher with the presence of afternoon buyers ensuring the local bourse extended its winning run to four consecutive positive finishes. By the close, the All Ordinaries index had climbed 9.6 points to 2,283.0, a rise of 42.2 on the week.</p>
<p>JOHANNESBURG - South African shares ended weak after a volatile day, with industrial shares see-sawing on futures-related trade and ahead of the unit-trust quarterly close-out, dealers said. &quot;It has been quite active and quite volatile. We started negative, then futures buying lifted industrials but now we have drifted back,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>Dealers said players were wary of gold shares on reports that the IMF could sell some of its gold reserves. The overall index was down 1.4 points to 6,933.1 points down 2.2 on the week, the industrial index fell 14.3 points to 8,179.2 points a fall of 11.6 from last Friday and the gold index slipped 18.1 points to 1,697 points and down 40.9 on the week.</p>
