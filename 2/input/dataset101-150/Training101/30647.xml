<p>Here is how major stock markets outside the United States ended on Monday.</p>
<p>LONDON - UK stocks snapped two days of declines to close higher, propelled by gains in oil stocks and underpinned by strength in the dollar and firm gilts. The FTSE 100 index closed up 16.8 points to 3,884.4.</p>
<p>FRANKFURT - German equities ended lacklustre bourse session half-a-percentage point lower, as U.S. Labor Day holiday takes impetus out of trade, sentiment was dampened by soft German debt, lower close on Wall Street on Friday.

The All-share Swiss Performance Index (SPI) rose 3.38 points to 2,346.37.</p>
<p>TOKYO - Tokyo stocks ended lower, after the key Nikkei index battled fiercely to avoid sinking past the 20,000 level on pressure from the Dow which weakened on Friday, trade was thin and centred around speculative, incentive-backed shares. The 225-issue benchmark Nikkei lost 59.79 points or 0.30 percent to close at 21,107.11.</p>
<p>HONG KONG - Hong Kong stocks ended the session weak, hit by fears of higher interest rates, but prices were off their lows by the close as bargain-hunters stepped in around support levels.
