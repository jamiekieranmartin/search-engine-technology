<headline>Closing stock market indices.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON</dateline>
<text>
<p>Here is how major stock markets outside the United States ended Friday.</p>
<p>LONDON - British stocks closed mostly higher, propelled by drug and oil issues but dragged off the day's highs by a weak Wall Street opening. The FTSE 100 index added 13.2 points to close at 3,946.4, but was down 17.7 for the week.</p>
<p>FRANKFURT - Shares fell on a mild bout of profit-taking but dealers said the underlying market was buoyed by the dollar's strength. The DAX index of Germany's 30 leading shares fell 7.51 points to 2,659.04, for a gain of 12.94 on the week. In post-bourse trade the index recovered a bit to 2,659.86.</p>
<p>PARIS - French shares finished firmer but off their best levels as the blue-chip CAC-40 index butted against resistance levels and then fell back. The blue chip CAC-40 index rose 2.91 points to 2,107.05, for a gain of 24.55 on the week.</p>
<p>ZURICH - Swiss shares ended a shade lower after a slow directionless session but dealers expected good fundamentals, such as a weaker Swiss franc, to lend support to the market in the near term. The all-share Swiss Performance Index fell 1.58 points to 2,373.07, which was up 4.65 from last Friday.</p>
<p>TOKYO - Stocks eked out small gains by the end of Friday's session after a three-day winning streak. The key 225-share Nikkei average rose 85.65 points to close at 21,547.02, which was up 434.78 from a week ago.</p>
<p>HONG KONG - Stocks closed at their highest level since February 1994, boosted by futures-led buying ahead of the expiry of September Hang Seng futures this session. The Hang Seng index added 123.26 points to 11,759.39. There was a gain of 167.09 since last Friday.</p>
<p>SYDNEY - The market closed higher for the fourth straight session. By the close, the All Ordinaries index had climbed 9.6 points to 2,283.0, a rise of 42.2 on the week.</p>
<p>JOHANNESBURG - South African shares ended weak after a volatile day. The overall index fell 1.4 points to 6,933.1, for a loss of 2.2 points for the week; the industrial index fell 14.3 points to 8,179.2, a drop of 11.6 from last Friday, and the gold index lost 18.1 points to 1,697 points and was down 40.9 on the week.</p>
