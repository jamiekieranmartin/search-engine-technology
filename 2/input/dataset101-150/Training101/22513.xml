<p>Iranian security forces have broken up five espionage rings in northwestern Iran and arrested 41 people on charges of spying for unnamed countries, a daily newspaper said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Jomhuri Eslami quoted the West Azerbaijan province security chief as saying those held confessed to gathering confidential information, photographing strategic sites, doing propaganda against state officials and &quot;spreading pan-Turkism&quot;.</p>
<p>It was not clear if they were the same five spy rings, allegedly led by Turkish diplomats, that Iran said in April it had broken up in the same area, which borders Turkey.</p>
<p>The April arrests were announced shortly after a row in which Tehran asked Ankara to withdraw four Turkish diplomats accused of spying, and Turkey expelled four Iranian diplomats for their alleged links to killings of Iranian exiles.</p>
<p>Ties between the two neighbours, strained also over a military accord between Turkey and Israel which drew strong Iranian objections, have improved since Islamist Necmettin Erbakan took over as Turkish prime minister in June.</p>
<p>The daily Iran on Thursday quoted Intelligence Minister Ali Fallahiyan as saying agents arrested 137 people for allegedly spying for Iraq, the United States and other unnamed countries in the Iranian year which ended on March 19.</p>
