<p>Wrangell-St. Elias National Park rangers on Sunday found the body of a British hiker missing since last week, the National Park Service said.</p>
<p>The body of David Richard Harrison, 31, of Shrewsbury, England, was found in a ravine near Dixie Pass in the remote park. Officials believed he died from a fall.</p>
<p>The statewide search for him started September 2, when his father, Peter Harrison of Lancashire, England, reported that his son  had not returned to his job teaching math at a private school.</p>
<p>The search was hindered by the lack of information about Harrison's planned trek, the Park Service said. He had failed to register or leave an itinerary with Wrangell-St. Elias rangers.</p>
<p>Neither is required at 13- million-acre (5,260,000 hectares) Wrangell-St. Elias, the largest U.S. national park, but both are recommended, Park Service officials said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is difficult to track visitors to Alaska who do not have a specific itinerary,&quot; Wrangell-St. Elias chief ranger Jay Wells said in a news release.</p>
<p>&quot;After several days of intensive investigative work the search area for this case was limited from a state-wide search to a Park-wide search, and finally, to a particular drainage.&quot;</p>
<p>Searchers tracked Harrison's movements after learning of postcard sent to his father that mentioned plans to hike in the park and a credit-card charge made to a transportation company in the area, officials said.</p>
<p>They also combed through maps that Harrison had left at an acquaintance's home in Anchorage, they said.</p>
<p>Harrison's hike took him along a trail that is well-established in the beginning but becomes obscure near Dixie Pass, Park Service spokesman John Quinley said.</p>
