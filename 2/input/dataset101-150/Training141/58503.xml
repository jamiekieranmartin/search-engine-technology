<p>President Clinton will use a visit to the Grand Canyon Wednesday as a vast backdrop to stress his environmental record and announce a plan to protect wilderness in Utah, but analysts described his performance on the environment as mixed.</p>
<p>Wednesday's appearance, where he is expected to proclaim nearly two million acres of Utah redrock canyons and plateaus safe from mining and development, is the latest in a series of postcard-setting events Clinton has used to blast Republicans as anti-environment.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't see Bill Clinton as a dyed-in-the-wool environmentalist. I think he understands the power of this issue to mobilize both the mass public and crucial Democratic party constituencies,&quot; said Christopher Foreman, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.</p>
<p>&quot;The president has discovered he can use the environment as an issue to beat the Republicans with, so the rhetoric is a lot stronger,&quot; said Terry Davies, of Resources for the Future, a Washington-based research institute.</p>
<p>In the environmental arena, Clinton mainly has been successful in blocking Republican initiatives, but has failed to pass most of his own, analysts said.</p>
<p>But they said Clinton failed to stop legislation last year that sharply increased logging in national forests, which wilderness advocates said will haunt him even this week at the Grand Canyon.</p>
<p>&quot;From our perspective the drama tomorrow will be Clinton there announcing the new national monument, and a group of forest activists will be nearby to call attention to a new salvage (logging) sale,&quot; said Jim Jontz, executive director of the Western Ancient Forest Campaign.</p>
<p>Clinton signed the measure pushed by the timber industry to increase cutting of salvage timber, or sick and dead trees. But the language was broad enough that it allowed logging of green trees, and forced the government to let the timber industry cut ancient trees in the Pacific Northwest that previously had been blocked to protect endangered species.</p>
<p>Clinton later said he regretted signing the measure, which was part of a broad spending bill, and called for its partial repeal.</p>
<p>&quot;The administration admits they dropped the ball on that. Clinton is taking positive steps, but the bleeding from the logging rider certainly mars his record,&quot; Jontz said.</p>
<p>Clinton balked at later attempts by Republicans to insert into broad spending bills measures to ease pollution rules or give industries more access to natural resources. That contributed to last winter's budget impasse that partially closed the government.</p>
<p>Backed by Republican moderates, Clinton also fended off efforts to weaken the federal government's power to enforce environmental, health and safety regulations, and to gut major pollution laws such as the Clean Air Act.</p>
<p>&quot;I think his biggest achievements and the things we are most grateful for is stopping this Congress from doing what it was trying to do,&quot; said Greg Wetstone, of the Natural Resources Defense Council.</p>
<p>Only two major pieces of environmental legislation cleared this Congress and were signed into law by Clinton -- measures on drinking water standards and food safety that got broad support from environmentalists, consumer advocates and the regulated industries.</p>
<p>While Clinton largely failed at his legislative agenda, Foreman of the Brookings Institution said he had been able to nudge the bureaucracy to improve its rules and had been able to broker deals between industries and environmentalists.</p>
<p>He failed to reform a 120-year old mining law or subsidized grazing on federal lands, but Foreman said Clinton had worked out deals such as protecting the Utah wilderness and blocking a huge gold mine near Yellowstone Park.</p>
<p>&quot;You finesse it by crafting something that appears to give all sides part of what they want. It's safe politics,&quot; he said.</p>
