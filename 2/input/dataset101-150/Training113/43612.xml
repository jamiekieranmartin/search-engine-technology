<p>Higher anticipated second half losses for Ford Motor Co's Brazilian affiliate will result from rising competition, coupled with huge investments in small-car production, a spokesman for the unit said.</p>
<p>&quot;The losses are tied to Ford's investment program of up to $1.0 billion in Brazil plus increasing competition in the Brazilian auto sector,&quot; communications manager Celio Batalha told Reuters. His comments followed an announcement by Ford in Detroit that the second-half performance of its Brazilian unit would be &quot;substantially worse&quot; than the first half.  </p>
<p>Although Ford has not given separate financial results for Brazil, it said its Latin American operations posted a loss of $129 million in the first half of 1996. Brazil accounts for the largest part of Ford's Latin American operations.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Ford do Brasil started production of its economy Fiesta model, its current top selling car. It also opened a motor and transmissions plants in Sao Paulo state.</p>
<p>Batalha said Ford's Brazilian operations were also hurt by fierce competition in the small car market, where top sellers Volkswagen AG, Fiat, General Motors and Ford fight it out for market share.</p>
<p>Ford do Brasil sold 19,773 vehicles in August, an increase of 33.8 percent over July. Sales of Fiestas, which are the country's fifth best selling car, totalled 8,921 last month, Batalha said.</p>
<p>Some analysts said these figures look poor when compared with Volkswagen's Gol model, Brazil's top selling car and Fiat's Palio, whose August sales totalled 34,767 and 24,136 units, respectively.</p>
