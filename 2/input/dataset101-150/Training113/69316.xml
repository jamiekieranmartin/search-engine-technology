<title>JAPAN: Japanese consumers hot on unusual cars.</title>

<p>Although the wallets of consumers are thinner and demand for pricey European cars has fizzled, Japanese are still keen on unusual or even bizarre vehicles so they can be different from their neighbours.</p>
<p>The hottest sellers are now smaller, cheaper recreational vehicles which Japan's automakers are launching one after another, analysts say.</p>
<p>Recreational vehicles became popular when the &quot;bubble economy&quot; popped in the late 1980s and consumers could no longer afford high-priced models such as Mercedes or BMW cars.</p>
<p>&quot;The boom in recreational vehicles will continue, but demand will focus more on compact models with engines of around 1500 cc,&quot; said Nikko Research analyst Noriyuki Matsushima.</p>
<p>Mazda Motor Corp's Demio, a compact station wagon with a 1.3 or 1.5 litre engine, is a perfect example, he said.</p>
<p>This is the first small station wagon to offer the comfort of a sedan along with features of a sport utility vehicle, such as four-wheel drive, analysts say. Its price tag is a comparatively painless 798,000 yen ($7,254).</p>
<p>Since its launch on September 18, the Demio has sparked orders nearly triple what Mazda had anticipated.</p>
<p>Mazda said it has received 14,500 orders, though it had projected just 5,000 sales per month. The unexpected demand has made the automaker plan for extra days of production in October, a company official said.</p>
<p>Toyota Motor Corp, Nissan Motor Co Ltd, Honda Motor Co Ltd and other makers are not about to let Mazda run away with this hot new market and have their own plans for similar vehicles.</p>
<p>Mini-car maker Daihatsu Motor Co Ltd already has a competing vehicle in the market, the Pyzar, and sales are strong but not as good as those of the Demio.</p>
<p>Daihatsu's Pyzar 1.5-litre compact wagon was launched on August 28 with a monthly sales target of 2,500 vehicles. It received 3,500 domestic orders in the first two weeks.</p>
<p>Toyota is gearing up to offer early next year a 1.5-litre compact vehicle which will likely be similar to the Demio and is nicknamed inside the company as &quot;Mammy's Cosy Room&quot; because it will be &quot;comfortable and small&quot;, industry sources say.</p>
<p>The vehicle will be assembled by Toyota's affiliate Kanto Auto Works Ltd, the sources added.</p>
<p>Nissan is also expected to be on the market soon with a compact car using components of its March 1300 cc compact car which is marketed abroad as the Micra, the industry sources said.</p>
<p>Honda plans to launch a 1300 cc Logo hatchback compact car on October 3, after abandoning its old mainstay, the 1300 City minicar, a big hit in Japan in the early 1980s with its unique box styling.</p>
<p>Carmakers are eager to move fast into the unique compact car market because sedan sales are no longer growing, analysts said.</p>
<p>Toyota in fact has been losing market share by trying to dwell too much on the traditional sedan market, they said. Even with its newly planned sedan campaign, they said, sedan sales were likely to decline.</p>
<p>Sedan models would face a tough situation as recreational vehicles continue to gain market share, Nikko's Matsushima said.</p>
