<p>Ford Motor Co said on Friday that the steep fall in first-half profits by its Chinese partner Jiangling Motors would not affect plans to introduce light commercial vehicles late next year.</p>
<p>&quot;The drop in profits will not delay the project,&quot; said Vaughn Koshkarian, president of Ford Motor (China) Ltd.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Jiangling Motors Corp Ltd announced its net profits for the first half of 1996 had tumbled 77 percent to 3.39 million yuan due to a sluggish market for motor vehicles.</p>
<p>Ford has a 20 percent stake in the venture with Jiangling.</p>
<p>&quot;They have been able to hold their head above water,&quot; Koshkarian told reporters.</p>
<p>Car and truck makers in China have been hurt by a prolonged austerity programme by the Chinese government to keep once surging inflation under control.</p>
<p>But inflation has been well within target this year and the central bank has been able to ease its tight money policies, cutting interest rates twice in less than four months.</p>
<p>Koshkarian said the overall market for cars and trucks this year would be 1.5 million cars, about the same as in 1995, despite a slight upturn expected in the second half.  </p>
<p>&quot;There should be some easing of the situation in the second half&quot; because of slightly easier credit, he said.</p>
<p>Ford's project with Jiangling, based in Nanchang in the eastern province of Jiangxi, eventually hopes to produce 60,000 light commercial vehicles a year.</p>
<p>Jiangling has both A and B class shares for domestic and foreign investors listed on the stock exchange in the southern city of Shenzhen.</p>
<p>Ford is part of five joint venture companies making auto parts in China. It has invested a combined $250 million in the China market, Koshkarian said.</p>
