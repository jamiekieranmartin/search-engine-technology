<p>A Chinese truck maker in which Ford Motor Co has a 20 percent stake said it posted a 77 percent drop in post-tax profits in the first half of 1996.</p>
<p>Jiangling Motors Corp, in a statement in Saturday's edition of the China Securities newspaper, said net profit in the period was 3.385 million yuan, down from 14.956 million in the same 1995 period.</p>
<p>Turnover fell to 937.891 million yuan from 1.215 billion, while net assets per share were 1.88 yuan, unchanged, and earnings per share fell to 0.005 yuan from 0.02 yuan, the statement said.</p>
<p>In the first half, the company said it produced 8,333 vehicles and sold 9,018, but it did not explain the difference.</p>
<p>It blamed the drop in profits on a weak vehicle market and said as its engine plant had only just started trial production, the company's results would not improve in the short-term.</p>
<p>Ford owns 138.643 million shares in the firm. The majority shareholder, with 51 percent, or 353.24 million shares, is Jiangling Motors Group.</p>
<p>The company, in the southern province of Jiangxi, had about eight percent of China's light truck market in 1994. ($1 = 8.3 yuan)</p>
