<p>The first car produced by Ford Motor Company in India rolled out of the assembly line on Monday, 10 months after government cleared the venture, the company said in a statement.</p>
<p>The Ford Escort is produced by a joint venture between Ford and India's Mahindra &amp; Mahindra (M&amp;M).</p>
<p>&quot;The speed with which this program has come together is indicative of the cooperation between the joint venture partners and the Maharashtra government,&quot; said Alex Trotman, chairman of Ford Motor Company, according to the statement.</p>
<p>M&amp;M and Ford each hold 50 percent in the Mahindra Ford joint venture at Nashik, 225 km (140 miles) north east of Bombay in the western Indian state of Maharashtra.</p>
<p>Ford Escort will be available in four models -- 1.3 petrol LX and 1.8 diesel LX and their standard series. Booking is expected to open next month.</p>
<p>M&amp;M is India's largest maker of utility vehicles and tractors. It has market share of 57 percent in utility vehicles and 28 percent in tractors.</p>
<p>Ford is the world's second largest car and trucker producer and is ranked second on the Fortune 500 list of the largest U.S. industrial corporations based on sales.</p>
