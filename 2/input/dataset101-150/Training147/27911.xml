<title>GERMANY: German gas distribution liberalisation underway.</title>
<headline>German gas distribution liberalisation underway.</headline>

<p>Germany is starting to deregulate its natural gas distribution business in accordance with EC guidelines, Dr Elmar Becker, Ministerial Director of the Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs said on Monday.</p>
<p>Becker told an industry conference here that discussion of a single market for gas under EC guidelines, and boosted by the Irish presidency, was under way.</p>
<p>&quot;If market liberalisation across Europe is to work, then parallel market liberalisation in member states must first take place,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;To give credibility to this and to set a good example, the Federal government has set an initiative for the distribution of gas. We expect it to be approved in September or October&quot;.</p>
<p>Becker was echoing comments made by economics minister Guenther Rexrodt on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;It should mean lower prices for consumers and will also be good from an ecological point of view,&quot; Becker added.</p>
<p>Gas use in Germany has grown at a tremendous pace, he told the conference, organised by the International Energy Agency.</p>
<p>&quot;Thirty years ago, gas accounted for only one percent of primary energy in Germany and Europe. Now it's 20 percent&quot;.</p>
<p>In eastern Germany, the change has been particularly rapid.</p>
<p>&quot;Since unification, we have converted households and pipelines to natural gas at a cost of 10 billion marks in four and a half years,&quot; he said. &quot;All agree natural gas will enjoy excellent prospects for growth.&quot;</p>
<p>The ministry estimates that gas as a proportion of Germany's primary energy will reach 22 percent by 2010, and 24 percent by 2020.</p>
<p>&quot;At present imports from Russia and North Africa are particularly important for Germany. But Norway is growing in importance - its supplies are on the doorstep of Europe&quot;.</p>
<p>Becker added that the federal government is working with German industry towards a voluntary commitment to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 20 percent by 2005.</p>
<p>&quot;To prevent further global warming it's important to use gas in vehicles - especially buses and freight fleets,&quot; he said adding that the government has reduced the tax on natural gas vehicles to boost the fleet's size.</p>
