<p>The American Automobile Association (AAA) and an oil industry group are locking horns over premium gasoline following claims by AAA that drivers are wasting $1.7 billion a year buying the higher-octane fuel.</p>
<p>&quot;Many drivers are falling for the 'octane myth' in gasoline ads and are giving $1.7 billion to the nation's oil industry needlessly,&quot; the Washington-based AAA said in a prepared statement issued Tuesday.  </p>
<p>&quot;That's dead wrong, they're giving short shrift to the facts,&quot; countered Thomas Hogarty, senior research manager for the American Petroleum Institute, who defended premium for promoting low-knock combustion.</p>
<p>&quot;Contrary to popular opinion, premium gas does not provide more power, doesn't improve performance, burn more clearly, reduce engine wear or improve mileage,&quot; AAA spokesman Dave Van Sickle insisted.  </p>
<p>The AAA said consumers should realize &quot;only exotic cars, some sport utility vehicles and vehicles with high-performance engines really need premium,&quot; which costs consumers about 15 cents a gallon more than regular grade fuel.</p>
<p>The nationwide auto club contended fewer than 10 percent of cars on U.S. roads needed premium although it constitutes nearly 20 percent of total gas sold.</p>
<p>Its renewed attack against premium echoes the Federal Trade Commission's own clarion call against premium last week.  </p>
<p>The federal agency, seeking to warn consumers against paying extra, sued Exxon Corp on Sept. 17 for making allegedly overblown advertising claims that premium enabled engines to run cleaner and with better mileage.</p>
<p>Exxon was the fourth major U.S. oil company called to task by the FTC, but the first not to settle before a suit was filed.</p>
<p>Hogarty conceded in a telephone interview there was little evidence premium reduced engine wear or improved mileage.</p>
<p>&quot;I won't argue with those points,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>But Hogarty said a recent study by the Coordinating Research Council, an oil industry group based in Atlanta, Georgia, showed 19 percent of U.S. vehicles needed premium to assure smooth combustion and prevent knocking and ping noises associated with lower-octane fuels.</p>
<p>&quot;Light trucks, vans and utility vehicles are less likely to get by on regular,&quot; he said, because of built-in vehicle &quot;knock sensors&quot; that limit acceleration ability if fuel quality is below the premium standard of 92- to 93-grade octane.</p>
<p>Regular octane level, a measure of resistance to knocking, is rated at 87-grade.  </p>
<p>What's more, Hogarty said vast numbers of old vehicles that once used anti-knock leaded fuel, now outlawed, can't operate properly on regular unleaded gasoline.</p>
<p>&quot;They (AAA) are giving short shrift to a lot of old cars and trucks,&quot; he said, adding that many of the vintage vehicles are operated in the western United States.</p>
