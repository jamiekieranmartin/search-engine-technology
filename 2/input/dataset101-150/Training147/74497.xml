<p>The New York Mercantile Exchange will launch an Alberta gas futures contract on September 27, in advance of the winter heating season which is normally viewed as the most volatile period for natural gas prices, Exchange President Patrick Thompson said Wednesday. The Exchange will launch a related options contract on November 1.  </p>
<p>Thompson said the futures contract would provide price transparency, so that participants in the natural gas industry could better see where supply and demand economics direct the flow of natural gas. As well, the contract allows participants to manage the price risk over time, whether at the producer level, the end user level or the trader/marketer level. &quot;Those price fluctuations are so substantial that without a risk management instrument people are not going to be in business very long,&quot; Thompson noted.  </p>
<p>The Alberta gas contract is the third such futures contract and the first non-U.S. delivery contract for the Exchange, Thompson said. In 1990, the Exchange launched the Henry Hub delivery point, the fastest growing contract on the Exchange, after the natural gas industry and transmissions systems were deregulated in the United States. As well, the Exchange recently listed electricity futures contracts for trading.  </p>
<p>Thompson said adding the Alberta delivery contract made sense because of the sometimes huge differentials in natural gas prices between the regions as a result of varying supply and demand economics and the demand for gas by electrical utilities. He said prices escalated rapidly last winter in the Eastern United States, but less so in the West. As a result, natural gas futures based on delivery in the Permian Basin in West Texas were launched last May to service the Southwestern and California markets. &quot;The final jewel in the natural gas complex will be the launch of the Alberta contract,&quot; Thompson told Calgary reporters.  </p>
<p>While Thompson said it would take two or three years for the Alberta futures market to grow to the stature of the physical industry, the Exchange anticipates a &quot;very volatile market&quot; because of the level of competition between various fuels such as coal, natural gas and heavy fuel oil, as well as weather conditions.</p>
<p>Exchange vice chairman Gary Lapayover said in Calgary that the gas contract could result in more Alberta gas flowing to the United States. That in turn could be an impetus to expanding Alberta's takeaway or export capacity, he added.  </p>
<p>Lapayover refused to speculate on the first day's trading volume, but said there would likely be an early &quot;spike&quot; before the market settles into a quieter trading pace. Beyond that, &quot;I would look over the next three to six months to see the market steadily increasing,&quot; Lapayover said, adding it will take two years to prove the success of the contract. -30-</p>
