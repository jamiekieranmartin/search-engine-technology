<p>Royal Dutch Shell's Nigerian unit has launched a gas gathering project, the first in a series planned to eliminate flaring by 2008, a senior company official said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;We have commenced work on the gas gathering project in the Western Division which was approved for implementation early in the year,&quot; Chris Haynes, technical manager of The Shell Development Company of Nigeria, told visiting reporters.</p>
<p>The project, located in Odidi, near the mid-western town of Warri, is expected to cost $250 million and to collect 80 million cubic feet of gas per day for supply to customers in the Lagos area, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We have planned that the plant comes on stream in 1999. The gas collected will be injected into the Escravos-Lagos pipeline for supply and distribution by the Nigerian Gas Company.&quot;</p>
<p>The Nigerian Gas Company is a subsidiary of state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Corp (NNPC).</p>
<p>Haynes said the Odidi project would gather gas flared only in the Western Division. &quot;This is because much of the gas flared in our Eastern Division will be routed to the Nigerian Liquefied Natural Gas plant once that comes on stream also in 1999.&quot;</p>
<p>Nigeria is constructing an LNG plant in Bonny, near the southeastern city of Port Harcourt.</p>
<p>On completion, the LNG plant is expected to reduce by 20 percent the volume of gas being flared by Shell.</p>
<p>Gas flaring is a sensitive issue in Nigeria, where communities in oil-producing areas constantly accuse multinational firms of environmental pollution.</p>
<p>The LNG project faced boycott threats following local and international pressure on Shell, the technical leader, to pull out in protest over Nigeria's hanging last year of nine minority rights activists for murder.</p>
<p>But Shell weathered the pressure to begin construction of the LNG plant in March, which is expected to produce 7.2 billion cubic metres of gas per year.</p>
<p>Haynes said apart from the Odidi project, other plans were being discussed between Shell and their partners which would involve an optimum use of gas to reduce flaring.</p>
<p>Chevron Corp is also executing a gas gathering project in Escravos, near Warri. It involves gathering and processing 96 percent of the gas now being flared in the Escravos area.</p>
<p>The first phase of the Chevron gas project, involving the processing of about 150 million cubic feet of associated gas per day, is expected to come on stream in May 1997 at a cost of $569 million.</p>
