<p>First gas through the new gas Interconnector from Scotland to Northern Ireland is due to flow on October 1, a British Gas Plc spokesman said Friday.</p>
<p>The 135 km pipeline from Dumfries and Galloway in southwest Scotland to the Ballylunford power station near Belfast is currently being commissioned in preparation for start up next month, the spokesman said.</p>
<p>From the 1,067 MW power station, a separate 26 km pipeline will take gas to a point near Carrickfergus, from where gas will connect to Belfast's disused former town gas network.</p>
<p>The Interconnector has been built by a 100 percent-owned British Gas unit, Premier Transco. British Gas also controls the Ballylunford power station through another subsidiary, Premier Power.</p>
<p>Natural gas in Northern Ireland will be distributed by Phoenix Natural Gas Ltd, another British Gas subsidiary which is currently wholly owned but was set up with the intention of becoming a joint venture company.</p>
<p>Phoenix is currently the exclusive gas distributor in Northern Ireland, and on Thursday announced its first sales contracts to Ryobi Aluminium Castings and Jury's Hotel.</p>
<p>Domestic customers will be added to the grid from early 1997, the British Gas spokesman said. Phoenix will have exclusive distribution rights to industrial consumers using more than 75,000 therms a year for three years, he added.</p>
<p>It will retain its monopoly over domestic users for eight years to allow for the fact that Phoenix will have to build up a domestic gas market from scratch, he said.</p>
<p>After that, the market will be open to competition, as it will be in the rest of the UK from early 1998. But Phoenix will retain a monopoly on gas transportation until 2016.</p>
