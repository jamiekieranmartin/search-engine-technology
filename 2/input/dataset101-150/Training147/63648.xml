<p>The launch of a natural gas industry in Northern Ireland is an important milestone for the province's economy and will create up to 500 jobs, a government official said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Gerry Loughran, permanent secretary at the Department of Economic Development, was speaking at a reception to mark the development by Phoenix Natural Gas Ltd of natural gas markets in the Belfast and Larne areas.</p>
<p>He said a feasibility study on the construction of a gas interconnector between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic was under way.</p>
<p>&quot;For the first time we will have a supply of natural gas,&quot; Loughran said. &quot;This will provide a major stimulus to the local energy market and to the growing Northern Ireland economy.&quot;</p>
<p>The new industry would help drive down energy costs and add to Northern Ireland's investment incentives, as well as bringing environmental benefits, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The establishment of a natural gas industry is also good news on the employment front. The installation of the infrastructure and the introduction of what will be a substantial new service industry will lead to the creation of about 500 new jobs,&quot; Loughran said.</p>
<p>He said the feasibility study on an interconnector with the Irish Republic involved the Department of Economic Development and Phoenix as well as the Irish Department of Energy and Irish state gas company Bord Gais.</p>
<p>He thanked British Gas Plc for its commitment to a total investment of over 450 million stg in the Northern Ireland natural gas project.</p>
<p>The European Union also contributed to the project, giving support of 80 million stg, its largest commitment to an individual project in Northern Ireland.</p>
