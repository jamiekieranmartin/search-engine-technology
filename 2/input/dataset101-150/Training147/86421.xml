<p>British Gas said on Monday it planned to stick with its domestic gas supply business after earlier ending talks to divest part of the operations to Scottish Hydro-Electric Plc.</p>
<p>&quot;This was a one-off deal,&quot; a British Gas spokeswoman said on the talks, which were halted on the initiative of both companies.</p>
<p>&quot;We absolutely have no intention to sell off part of the operation and there are no other deals in the offing,&quot; she added.</p>
<p>Her comments followed a terse statement on Sunday in which British Gas and Scottish Hydro said they had broken off talks after the Sunday Telegraph reported that the two firms were discussing a deal worth 250 million pounds ($390 million).</p>
<p>Scottish Hydro had approached British Gas a couple of months ago to buy the domestic gas supply business in Scotland and northern England, British Gas said on Monday.</p>
<p>But it declined to make any comments on the reported value of the discussed deal.</p>
<p>Industry regulator Ofgas had been consulted but British Gas said it and Scottish Hydro failed to reach an agreement due to commercial reasons rather than to regulatory pressure.</p>
<p>&quot;We looked at it very seriously but still decided it was not in the best interest of the company,&quot; the spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>She added there had been no talks with other companies than Scottish Hydro.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think you would find another proposition on the table anyway which offered the same attributes that this one had,&quot; the spokeswoman said without elaborating.</p>
<p>According to stock market talk earlier this year, several major oil companies were said to be eyeing British Gas's struggling gas supply business.</p>
<p>The rumours were most prominent when British Gas in February announced plans to demerge in 1997, separating gas supply from its money spinner TransCo, which is responsible for the pipeline and storage operations.</p>
<p>TransCo is currently subject to a crucial price review by Ofgas and British Gas has until October 7 to decide whether it will accept the regulator's tough proposals or have the matter vetted by the Monopolies and Merger Commission.</p>
<p>The loss-making gas supply business is, meanwhile, undergoing drastic changes as competition hots up.</p>
<p>The market to supply big industrial users was already opened up several years ago, triggering a collapse of British Gas's market share to around 35 percent.</p>
<p>The utility, privatised 10 years ago, is doing better in the domestic consumer market. In a pilot project started in April in the south west of England, some 70,000 consumers out of a total 500,000 households have switched to rivals.</p>
<p>Competition in the south east of England is scheduled to be introduced in January and February, while the rest of Britain will follow the year after.</p>
<p>The speedy introduction of competition has created big problems for British Gas, which is obliged to buy fixed amounts of gas from North Sea producers even if it cannot find a market.</p>
<p>The company is currently in talks to soften the impact of the contracts. The Sunday Telegraph reported that British Gas was expected to announce a deal with British Petroleum and Royal Dutch/Shell Group on the take-or-pay matter within the next month.</p>
<p>But the British Gas spokeswoman said this was speculation. ($1=.6405 Pound)</p>
