<headline>British Gas ends sale talks with Scottish Hydro.</headline>

<p>British Gas, which is battling to iron out regulatory and contractual problems before a planned demerger, said on Sunday it had considered selling its domestic gas supply business in Scotland and northern England.</p>
<p>But the company, which earlier this month reported a drop in first half pre-tax profits, said talks on the possible sale to Scottish Hydro-Electric had now ended, nipping in the bud speculation the company would shed its national presence.  </p>
<p>&quot;British Gas and Hydro-Electric confirm that they were in discussion about the possible purchase by Hydro-Electric of the domestic gas supply business of British Gas in Scotland and northern England,&quot; a spokeswoman for British Gas told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;These talks are no longer being pursued and as a result no further announcement will be made,&quot; she said, later declining to comment on wider questions over the group's future or whether it would pursue talks with other interested parties.  </p>
<p>Earlier the Sunday Telegraph newspaper said the British energy giant was in talks with power company Scottish Hydro-Electric on the sale, which the paper said would have been for an estimated 250 million pounds ($390.3 million).</p>
<p>A joint statement by Scottish Hydro-Electric and British Gas was made late in the day in response to the Sunday Telegraph report and before trading in the companies' shares resumed on Monday morning in London.</p>
<p>The report said British Gas was thought to be prepared to sell its domestic gas business in Scotland, Northumberland and Cumbria, supplying around 2.3 million homes.  </p>
<p>Monday's edition of the Times newspaper said the sale would have been welcomed by the Gas Consumers Council (GCC). The watchdog's director was reported to have said a sale would have been a &quot;win-win&quot; deal for customers and the two companies.</p>
<p>The paper said the GCC thought consumers would benefit from reduced gas prices, Scottish Hydro-Electric would expand its gas interests and British Gas would have an opportunity to escape loss-making &quot;take-or-pay&quot; supply contracts with British Petroleum, Shell and other oil companies.</p>
<p>Both newspapers said the sale would have involved Scottish Hydro taking on some of the onerous supply contracts.  </p>
<p>British Gas is currently renegotiating these contracts and is expected to announce a deal with BP and Shell within the next month, the Sunday Telegraph reported.</p>
<p>This agreement would involve British Gas paying the two oil giants up to 50 million pounds in return for them reducing the volume of the contracts and the price it has to pay, it added.</p>
<p>At the time of its results earlier this month, British Gas chairman Richard Giordano said he hoped to conclude two or three small renegotiations quickly. The contracts, negotiated when the company's monopoly was still intact, oblige it to pay prices for gas which are well above market rates.  </p>
<p>The Sunday Telegraph said a deal with Scottish Hydro would have prepared British Gas for its planned demerger next year and the start of full competition in the gas market in 1998.</p>
<p>The company said earlier this month that progress towards splitting into two separate companies, Transco International and British Gas Energy, is still on target for next spring, with a definite plan expected by the end of 1996.</p>
<p>British Gas has only one week to respond to price reviews by regulator Ofgas, which has said it wants Transco to cut charges to gas suppliers by 20 percent in 1997 and then 6.5 points below inflation for four years.  </p>
<p>Giordano said at the company's results that the two were closer to reaching agreement on the domestic review, where Ofgas wants to fix price changes at five point below inflation, with a resolution in prospect by late September or mid-October. ($1=.6405 Pound)</p>
