<p>U.S. West Coast product prices eased slightly as traders focused on weaker futures, briefly offsetting a generally bullish forecast for the region, as maintenance season begins.</p>
<p>October gasoline on NYMEX closed 1.74 cents lower Thursday at 61.32 cents a gallon amid concerns about imports and higher stocks.</p>
<p>Locally, key refiners such as Chevron, El Segundo, and Arco were under repairs of preparing for maintenance, while regional stocks of gasoline remained at relatively low levels of 26.9 million.  </p>
<p>Traders heard rumors of a possible deal between Ultramar and small Powerine refinery, located in Santa Fe Springs, Calif. Under the rumored terms, Ultramar would own crude and gasoline which mothballed Powerine would process for a fee.</p>
<p>No date was set for the potential pact, despite rumors of late September start-up at the refinery.</p>
<p>But a trader familiar with Ultramar's supplies said the oil company had not bought any additional crude for October.</p>
<p>Conventional or &quot;clear&quot; grade gasoline in Los Angeles fell a cent to 66/67 cents a gallon. Discounts for San Francisco grade widened a cent to two cents below L.A. material.</p>
<p>And Premium conventional in L.A. was nine cents over regular on ongoing problems with key Mobil gasoline unit.</p>
<p>Ultra-clean CARB gasoline in L.A. gave back two cents to hit 70.50/71 cents a gallon.</p>
<p>Deals for October and September cost nearly the same, as business shifted to the later month.</p>
<p>Bids for CARB diesel in L.A. were flat at 76/77 with low sulphur at off about a cent to 70.50/71.50 cents.</p>
<p>Distillates are expected to soften, with cargoes expected soon.</p>
