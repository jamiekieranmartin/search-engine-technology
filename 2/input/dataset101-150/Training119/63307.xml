<headline>FOCUS--Gasoline ends lower on oversupply concerns.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-09-19</dateline>

<p>Gasoline prices in New York ended sharply lower Thursday as talk of imports from Europe arriving on top of ample U.S. stocks fueled concerns of oversupply, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a combination of imports when we have ample supply, and the gasoline season being now over,&quot; said Gerald Samuels, managing director of ARB Oil.</p>
<p>Gasoline for October delivery settled down 1.74 cent at 61.32 cents a gallon on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) after falling as low as 60.40 cents during the day.  </p>
<p>Gasoline demand traditionally peaks during the summer, and inventory draws during the summer were considered lackluster by traders.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, shipping sources have noticed a sharp increase in charters for gasoline shipments from Europe to the United States in September.</p>
<p>October crude oil settled off 35 cents to $23.54 a barrel and October heating oil settled 1.10 cent lower to 66.77 cents a gallon on profit-taking.  </p>
<p>Crude and heating oil rallied strongly Wednesday after inventory data from the American Petroleum Institute showed a much smaller-than-expected build in heating oil. Heating oil stocks are at historical lows as winter approaches.</p>
<p>Traders said the demand for heating oil and the demand for crude to produce it contained Thursday's selling in both.</p>
<p>The weaker fundamentals in gasoline have made it a laggard on the NYMEX for months, though traders and analysts said gasoline prices could go higher during the winter as refiners produce less gasoline in favor of heating oil.  </p>
<p>&quot;There has been a great deal of pressure on gasoline for some time, but things will change later in the season, and then one can make a strong case for it,&quot; said Thomas Blakeslee of Cargill Investor Services.</p>
<p>Traders said market forces are also creating a disincentive for refiners to make gasoline due to the deteriorating premium of gasoline over crude oil, which hurts profitability.</p>
