<p>South African mining giant Anglo American Corp said on Thursday it will launch a multi-million rand (dollar) probe into developing two new ultra-deep gold mines up to five km (three miles) below surface.</p>
<p>The 33 million rand ($7.34 million) survey, using a seismic technique similiar to sonar scanning, will concentrate on an area south of Anglo's existing Western Deep Levels Ltd mine southwest of Johannesburg.</p>
<p>Western Deep Levels is the deepest mine in the world, sinking nearly four kilometres (2.5 miles) into the crust.</p>
<p>&quot;The survey will begin soon and will take between six and 12 months to complete,&quot; said Bobby Godsell, chairman of Anglo's Gold and Uranium Division.</p>
<p>&quot;It should provide us with a better understanding -- down to 5,000 metres -- of major geological structures,&quot; he said in a statement.</p>
<p>Godsell said in June this year that new technology and improved workers' skills now made it possible to reach ore deposits that were previously inaccessible.</p>
<p>Anglo believed there was an amount of gold of the order of 1,750 tonnes with an in situ grade of 12 grammes/tonne.</p>
<p>The new finds in the West Rand region would cost around five billion rand ($1.1 billion) each to develop and have a lifetime of around 25 years, the company said in June.</p>
<p>Also on Thursday, Anglo triggered the first blast, marking the start of the 1.1 billion rand South Shaft deepening project at the mine.</p>
<p>The project will deepen the shaft by about 670 metres, to a world record 3,841 metres below surface.</p>
<p>Anglo said it expected to gain an extra 475 tonnes of gold through the project and extend the life of the mine by 14 years. Full production should be reached by 2005.</p>
<p>The cost of extracting gold have soared in recent years, partly because of the depth of South African mines.</p>
<p>South Africa mined 522.4 tonnes of gold last year, about 23 percent of world production. The Witwatersrand basin around Johannesburg has about 40 percent of the world's known gold reserves.</p>
