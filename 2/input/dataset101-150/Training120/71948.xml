<p>South African police fired tear gas and rubber bullets on Tuesday to quell a new outbreak of ethnic clashes between gold miners in which 21 have been killed in the past three days, a spokesman said.</p>
<p>The police spokesman told reporters three miners from the gold mining area around Klerksdorp, 160 km (100 miles) southwest of Johannesburg, were killed in fighting overnight between members of the Xhosa and Sotho tribes.</p>
<p>He said the toll since Saturday midnight stood at 21 dead and 38 seriously injured. In the first clashes early on Sunday, seven miners were killed when assailants blew up their homes with blasting explosives.</p>
<p>&quot;This morning the two groups attacked each other again and police fired tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse them. The situation is quiet now,&quot; the spokesman said.</p>
<p>It is not clear what sparked the Klerksdorp fighting, but newspapers have reported that one group of miners had decided to avenge a colleague who was killed in a fight over a woman.</p>
<p>The clashes have centred on the Buffelsfontein Gold Mining Company Ltd , owned by marginal mines specialist Randgold &amp; Exploration Co Ltd , which recently bought it from Gencor Ltd .</p>
<p>In July and August about 30 miners were killed in ethnic clashes on four other mines, run by Gold Fields of South Africa Ltd .</p>
<p>President Nelson Mandela has appointed a judicial inquiry into the fighting.</p>
<p>Migrant labourers at most of the country's mines are accommodated in hostels segregated by ethnic group. Union leaders say the system is a legacy of apartheid but mine managers say the workers do not want to be forced to share housing with members of other tribes.</p>
