<p>Twelve people were killed and another 14 badly hurt in attacks on mine workers northwest of Johannesburg at the weekend in what police said on Monday seemed to be ethnic conflict.</p>
<p>Seven died when eight home-made bombs packed onto the roofs and walls of their compound exploded in the early hours of Sunday, horribly mutilating some of them. Three others died when they were attacked with knives and sticks while trying to flee.</p>
<p>Another two workers burnt to death at a nearby mine hostel early on Monday when they were set alight by their attackers.</p>
<p>Their bodies were burnt beyond recognition, police said.</p>
<p>&quot;The reason for the attacks seem to be faction fighting between Pondos and Sothos. There is a history of this -- it's been going on here for ages,&quot; Senior Superintendent Pieter du Plessis told Reuters, adding this was the worst violence so far.</p>
<p>&quot;The situation is very tense still. We think there will be a retaliation for these attacks. We have policemen patrolling the area and mine security is also involved,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Policemen on the scene recovered four devices packed with commercial explosives used on the mines, which had failed to detonate. Investigations are continuing.</p>
<p>The attacks took place near two mines, the Hartebeestfontein Gold Mining Company Ltd owned by Anglo-Vaal Ltd and Gencor Ltd's Buffelsfontein Gold Mining Company Ltd.</p>
<p>Mine officials were not immediately available for comment.</p>
<p>President Nelson Mandela recently appointed a judicial commission of inquiry to investigate ethnic violence on four other mines, run by Gold Fields of South Africa Ltd .</p>
<p>At least 30 miners have been killed and scores more injured in two months of fighting on these mines, three of which produce gold and the other, platinum.</p>
<p>It is unclear why the violence has suddenly reignited.</p>
<p>Labour Minister Tito Mboweni has called for a wide-ranging inquiry into South Africa's mining industry to examine why conflicts on mines often spread into ethnic violence, saying:</p>
<p>&quot;It is quite clear that some of the root causes of this violence are historical and in a sense some of the chickens are coming home to roost at the wrong time when now there is a democratic government.&quot;</p>
<p>South Africa's mining industry was built on a labour system whereby men left their wives and families for months at a time to work on the mines. Mine hostels were largely segregated on ethnic lines with Zulus, Xhosas or Basotho in separate quarters.</p>
