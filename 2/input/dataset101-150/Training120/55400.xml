<p>Anxious to compete globally and to disprove talk of its imminent demise, South Africa's gold mining industry is seeking new ways to survive -- even if it means sending men five km (three miles) underground.</p>
<p>The country's gold mines are already the deepest in the world, extending down to 3,170 metres (10,400 ft).</p>
<p>Now the biggest mining house, Anglo American Corp of South Africa Ltd, plans a quantum leap to snatch the riches it knows lie far beneath the earth.</p>
<p>Earlier this month Anglo announced a 33 million rand ($7.3 million) seismic survey for two new ultra-deep mines that would bore up to five km below the surface.</p>
<p>The mines on the West Rand -- believed to hold 1,750 tonnes of gold in situ grading 12 grammes/tonne -- would cost five billion rand each to develop and have a life of 25 years.</p>
<p>&quot;This prospect is an indication of why we believe the South African gold mining industry is far from on its last legs,&quot; said Bobby Godsell, chairman of Anglo's gold and uranium division.</p>
<p>&quot;The industry is not dead and it is not three-quarters in the grave like some believe.&quot;</p>
<p>Since output peaked in the 1970s at around 1,000 tonnes a year, South African gold output has fallen steadily to only 522.4 tonnes last year, the lowest since 1958.</p>
<p>Faced with rising costs, South African mining houses are determined to get as much gold as cheaply as possible from the country's ageing mines -- by rethinking recovery methods.</p>
<p>Some houses are merging neighbouring mines to share shaft and plant infrastructure and reduce overhead costs. Some are recycling waste dumps and some even burn underground railway sleepers to gather any gold dust on them.</p>
<p>Currently in the pipeline is Gencor Ltd's Evander mine merger which will see the combination of four gold mines into one company, Evander Gold Mines.</p>
<p>The new &quot;super mine&quot; would be South Africa's seventh largest, producing 23 tonnes a year, with inferred gold reserves of 12.7 million ounces.</p>
<p>Another recent merger to improve efficiency was that of Blyvooruitzicht Gold Mining Co Ltd last year with Doornfontein Gold Mining Co Ltd.</p>
<p>Hunger to recover gold has even altered the Johannesburg city skyline. Known as the &quot;City of Gold&quot;, its name was once illustrated by the numerous gold mine waste dumps that lined the &quot;Golden Highway&quot; circling the city.</p>
<p>Processing these tailings dams has proved profitable, both here and in the Witwatersrand area, and they are fast being recycled and disappearing.</p>
<p>&quot;Over the past five years the industry has been working through tailings dams. The last two years in particular have seen a lot of use of low grade surface to supplement the low production levels underground,&quot; said Roger Baxter, economist with the employers' representative body, the Chamber of Mines.</p>
<p>Driefontein Consolidated Ltd in the three months to end-June recovered 381 kg (840 lb) of gold from its reclamation plant and Stilfontein Gold Mining Co Ltd, whose underground operations are closed, produced 127 kg (280 lb) from surface recovery.</p>
<p>It is not only the methods of recovery that are altering but also the traditional structure of South Africa's mining houses.</p>
<p>For more than a century they were sovereign, presiding over South Africa's mineral deposits.</p>
<p>Now, rising costs and declining ore grades have seen them prepared to relinquish expensive marginal operations, heralding the arrival of a new kind of low-cost player.</p>
<p>Running with tight margins, Randgold and Exploration Co Ltd has won itself a name as a shelter for marginal mines. Late last year Gencor sold Randgold four low-productivity mines that it believed it could manage more efficiently.</p>
<p>Despite South Africa's gold mining industry's determination to survive, analysts say the country's deep-level and marginal mines are failing to attract investors when ore can be scooped out of opencast pits elsewhere in Africa.</p>
<p>&quot;The world doesn't need any more deep South African gold mines,&quot; said John Clemmow, analyst at stockbrokers Fergusson Brothers.</p>
<p>&quot;If you had a dollar in your hand and wanted to invest it to make the most money, one of the last places you'd put it is into a deep South African gold mine.&quot;</p>
<p>South African mining houses, too, have been keen to move into the rest of Africa in the wake of the country's political rehabilitation following the first democratic elections in 1994.</p>
<p>But the industry insists its domestic mines are far from dead with numerous expansion projects underway.</p>
<p>&quot;You're seeing capital projects being announced all the time. They (industry) wouldn't spend that amount of money if they didn't see a future,&quot; Baxter said, noting capital projects last year totalled 9.7 billion rand.</p>
<p>South Africa still produces the most gold in the world and is not going to surrender its title just yet.</p>
<p>The country's output of 522.4 tonnes last year represented 23 percent of total global output. The United States, the world's second largest source, produced 329.3 tonnes.</p>
<p>&quot;South Africa's gold mining industry is the most developed in the world. It is still going to be the number one producer for the next 10 years at least,&quot; Baxter said.</p>
<p>&quot;Our reserves go on a lot longer than anyone else's. The gold is always going to be there and we can always mine it but we have to find ways of cutting costs to make it worthwhile.&quot;</p>
<p>Mechanical engineering is only one of the keys to new projects. Equally, if not more important, is the task of re-engineering industrial relations.</p>
<p>Anglo's Godsell believes he can make those labour relations work in the new ultra-deep mines, freeing the gold mining industry from an unhappy reputation of management and labour conflict.</p>
<p>The fate of Anglo's Free State Consolidated Gold Mines Ltd, the world's largest, gives some hope for the future.</p>
<p>The mine was brought back from the brink after being threatened with the closure of five shafts and the loss of 10,000 jobs earlier this year, when management and unions struck a breakthrough deal to increase productivity. ($=4.48 rand)</p>
