<p>Three people were killed and four injured in a coal mine explosion near Cebu city in the central Philippines on Thursday, a mining company official said.</p>
<p>Nine other miners working in a mine shaft at the time of the blast scrambled out to safety, Roque Medalle, manager of the Manguerra Mining and Development Corp, which owns the mine, said in a radio interview.</p>
<p>&quot;A spark might have triggered the explosion. What we are trying to establish now is what caused the spark,&quot; Medalle told private radio station DYDD.</p>
<p>Medalle said he was making the rounds of the mine site when &quot;I heard an explosion&quot; from the mouth of the shaft.</p>
<p>He said the blast appeared to have come from a depth of some 400 metres (about 1,300 feet) inside the mine.</p>
<p>The mine, owned by a Filipina businesswoman, is located in Dalaguete municipality, about 85 km (55 miles) southeast of Cebu city.</p>
