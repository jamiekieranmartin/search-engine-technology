<p>Three South African miners were killed overnight in renewed ethnic clashes at a gold mine southwest of Johannesburg, taking the death toll since the weekend to 24, police said on Thursday.</p>
<p>They said another three people had been injured in the fighting between Xhosa and Sotho workers at a mine hostel, one of them critically.</p>
<p>The fighting has centred on Buffelsfontein Gold Mining Company Ltd, near Klerksdorp 160 km (100 miles) southwest of Johannesburg, which is owned by Randgold &amp; Exploration Co Ltd.</p>
<p>Randgold said on Wednesday output had not been affected.</p>
<p>Earlier this week police raided hostels at the mine and seized explosives and home-made spears and axes.</p>
<p>The violence erupted last Sunday when one of the groups used explosives employed in underground blasting against the homes of rivals, killing at least seven people.</p>
<p>The reasons for the violence were unclear but more than 50 miners have been killed since July in ethnic fighting. President Nelson Mandela has appointed a judge to probe the causes.</p>
