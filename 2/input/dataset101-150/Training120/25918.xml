<headline>Cambodia investigates reports of Briton's death.</headline>
<dateline>PHNOM PENH 1996-08-31</dateline>

<p>Senior Cambodian military and provincial officials said on Saturday they had received no evidence to confirm a report that Khmer Rouge guerrillas have executed British mines disposal expert Christopher Howes.</p>
<p>Prom Sanein, deputy commander of the fourth military region where Howes and his interpreter Houn Hourth were abducted in late March, had heard nothing new on the 36-year-old Briton.</p>
<p>Howes, from the Mines Advisory Group (MAG), was part of a five-man team of expatriate mine specialists training civilians in the detection and destruction of anti-personnel mines.</p>
<p>Hem Bunheng, a deputy governor of the northwest province of Siem Reap, said by telephone that he and the military had received no information that Howes had been killed, adding: &quot;the situation is normal.&quot;</p>
<p>A source in Thailand, citing an informant, said he believed Howes was still alive and being held in areas controlled by one-legged Khmer Rouge commander Ta Mok.</p>
<p>The Bangkok Post on Friday carried a front page report from the Thai-Cambodian border citing an unnamed Khmer Rouge officer as saying that Howes had been executed at noon on Thursday in Ta Mok's northern stronghold of Anlong Veng.</p>
<p>The officer, loyal to Khmer Rouge supremo Pol Pot and Ta Mok in a split within the secretive movement, gave no clear reason for the alleged murder saying only that it was linked to a rebellion on Wednesday by dissidents in a Pol Pot camp.</p>
<p>The report said one of two Cambodians seized with Howes in March had died of malaria in July, but observers said Houn Hourth was the only known Cambodian captive.</p>
<p>A MAG official in Phnom Penh said that as far as the organisation was concerned the latest development was still an unconfirmed report, while a British diplomat said the embassy was trying to corroborate the report.</p>
<p>Troops loyal to Ieng Sary, foreign minister in Pol Pot's brutal 1975-79 Khmer Rouge regime, have broken with the hardliners and opened peace negotiations with the government.</p>
<p>Khmer Rouge radio, which remains under the control of Pol Pot and Ta Mok loyalists, signalled the rift on August 8 when it accused Ieng Sary of massive embezzlement and ordered his execution.</p>
<p>Ieng Sary was sentenced to death in absentia for his roles in the premature deaths of more than one million people during the Khmer Rouge rule.</p>
<p>The Maoist faction was included in the U.N.-brokered peace pact of 1991 but later reneged on the deal and has been fighting the coalition government that emerged from general elections in 1993.</p>
<p>The rebels have since abducted at least seven westerners and are known to have killed six of them.</p>
