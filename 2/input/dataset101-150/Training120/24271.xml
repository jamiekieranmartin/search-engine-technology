<headline>China sets law allowing sale of mineral rights.</headline>

<p>China's parliament has passed a law protecting mineral resources by affirming state ownership and ending a ban on sales of mining rights, the Xinhua news agency said on Friday.</p>
<p>The law, which takes effect on January 1, 1997, is designed to end confusion over ownership of mineral resources, making clear that all mineral resources belong to the Chinese state, as exercised by the State Council, or cabinet.</p>
<p>The law will replace the current mineral resource law, which dates to 1986 and was regarded as outdated.</p>
<p>Under the existing law, state ownership is only vaguely referred to, prompting local governments to assume they could control mineral resources without central government approval.</p>
<p>This has led to confusion over management in China's mining sector as well as excessive mining and wasted resources, the Economic Infornation Daily said.</p>
<p>China has frequently closed what it considered to be illegal gold and coal mines in a bid to protect state interests.</p>
<p>The new law prohibits individuals and firms from conducting mining in areas legally belonging to state-owned mining enterprises. It states that violators can be punished, ranging from confiscation of assets to penalties under the criminal law code.</p>
<p>Firms will be required to pay a natural resources tax and other compensation to the state in order to obtain prospecting and mining rights.</p>
<p>The new law also sets the legal foundation for foreign investors to enter China's prospecting and mining industries, the newspaper said, quoting an official of the Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources.</p>
<p>It did not give details of mining by foreigners, saying only that additional regulations would be issued.</p>
