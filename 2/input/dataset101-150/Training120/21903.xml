<p>A Russian airliner carrying coal miners to the remote Arctic island of Spitzbergen crashed into a snow-capped mountain as it came in to land on Thursday, almost certainly killing all 143 passengers and crew on board.</p>
<p>The Tupolev Tu-154 was carrying mostly Ukrainian miners and some of their families to a Russian open-cast mine on the island. Spitzbergen is governed by Norway but Russia has rights of access under an international treaty from the 1920s.</p>
<p>&quot;The accident is a tragedy and a catastrophe for the Russian mining community,&quot; the island's governor, Ann Kristin Olsen, told Norway's NTB news agency.</p>
<p>&quot;We can't say it's impossible to find survivors but when there's a crash that pulverises the plane...the chances are very slim,&quot; Rune Baard Hansen, the deputy governor, told Reuters.</p>
<p>In Moscow, Russian officials said five people may have survived when the plane hit the mountain in bad weather as it came in to land at Longyear, the main town on Spitzbergen. But Norwegian officials said they found no survivors so far.</p>
<p>Officials said there were 129 passengers, including some women and children, and a crew of 14 on the plane.</p>
<p>The coalminers were on their way to start work in the Russian mining town of Barentsburg, relieving colleagues who were already waiting at Longyear airport to fly home on the doomed plane when it crashed.</p>
<p>Air traffic control lost contact with the flight shortly before its scheduled landing time of 10.15 a.m. (0815 GMT).</p>
<p>The plane plunged into a mountainside and broke up some seven km (four miles) east of Longyear.</p>
<p>There are no roads leading to the snowbound crash site and officials said operations to recover bodies and examine the wreckage were temporarily suspended at around 1400 GMT because of fog and strong freezing winds.</p>
<p>Officials said there was no indication yet as to the possible cause of the crash, although Norwegian air safety experts had launched an investigation.</p>
<p>Some aviation experts have raised questions about the safety of Russian airline operations following the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991.</p>
<p>If all 143 people are confirmed dead, the crash would be the worst in Norwegian history. The plane had been chartered by coal mining company Trust Arktik Ugol.</p>
<p>The first rescuers arrived shortly after 1 p.m. (1100 GMT) and reported that most of the three-engine jet's wreckage was scattered around the top of the small Opera mountain while the rest was found on the snow-covered slopes.</p>
<p>More than 100 miners who had been waiting at Longyear to fly home on the plane were being taken care of by the local priest and mining company officials.</p>
<p>&quot;The mood is partly shock and deep grief. Quite a few of them lost family in the crash, they are crushed,&quot; Hansen said.</p>
<p>The Russian community on Spitzbergen numbers less than 2,000 people, in the mining towns of Barentsburg and Pyramiden.</p>
<p>The Norwegian mining town of Longyear, the only other settlement, has about 1,000 inhabitants. Spitzbergen lies some 500 miles (800 km) off the north coast of Norway.</p>
<p>Russian President Boris Yeltsin sent a message of condolence to the families of those who died on Thursday and asked the government to help the bereaved families.</p>
<p>Norway's King Harald and Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland both sent telegrams of condolence to Moscow.</p>
<p>The last air disaster involving a plane of the same make was in June 1994, when a China Northwest Airlines Tu-154 crashed, killing all 146 passengers and 14 crew on board.</p>
<p>In January of the same year, a Russian Tu-154 crashed in Siberia, killing all 124 people on board.</p>
