<p>An airliner carrying coal miners from Russia crashed into a mountain on Thursday on the remote Arctic island of Spitzbergen and all 141 passengers and crew were feared to have died, Norwegian officials said.</p>
<p>Norwegian officials on Spitzbergen rejected a report from Moscow that five people had survived when the Tupolev jet crashed as it approached the island's only airport.</p>
<p>If all 141 people are confirmed dead, the crash would be the worst in Norwegian history.</p>
<p>The island governor's office said no survivors had been found and rejected the Russian report.</p>
<p>&quot;This is totally unknown to us and wrong,&quot; it said. &quot;In that case they must have walked away from the site without us noticing, so that has got to be wrong.&quot;</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the Russian Emergencies Ministry said her ministry had a report from the crash site that five people may have survived the crash.</p>
<p>But a spokesman for Vnukovo Airlines, which owned the plane that was flying the miners to the Arctic settlement, could not confirm the report.</p>
<p>The accident occurred in bad weather 10 km (six miles) east of Longyearbyen. The jet crashed at a remote site, with no roads nearby.</p>
<p>&quot;No survivors have been found and our first aid staff are returning from the crash site,&quot; local government official Kjetil Hansen told reporters.</p>
<p>The plane had been chartered by coal mining company Trust Arktik Ugol.</p>
<p>The Norwegian aviation inspectorate said the plane was making a normal instrument landing and was in touch with Longyearbyen airport when it crashed.</p>
<p>The miners were travelling to work in one of the island's three open-cast coal mines. Some of them were accompanied by their families, Russian officials told the Norwegian news agency.</p>
<p>Air traffic officials said they had lost contact with the flight, scheduled to arrive at around 10.15 a.m. (0815 GMT), shortly before it was due to land.</p>
<p>First rescuers arrived shortly after 1 p.m. and reported that most of the three-engine jet's wreckage was scattered around the top of the small Opera mountain while the rest was found on the slopes.</p>
<p>The miners, most of them Ukrainians, represented a considerable part of the Russian community on Spitzbergen, which numbers around 2,000 people.</p>
<p>They were due to replace more than 100 other Russian miners who should have returned to Moscow on the doomed flight.</p>
<p>Their colleagues wept when they were told the plane had crashed a few minutes away from the landing site, Norwegian radio reported.</p>
<p>Spitzbergen is a Norwegian coal-mining settlement. The only other community is in the Russian village of Barentsburg. Russia and Norway share the island's resources under a treaty dating back to the 1920s.</p>
