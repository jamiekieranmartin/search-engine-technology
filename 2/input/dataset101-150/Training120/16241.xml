<p>Labour Minister Tito Mboweni backed a wide-ranging inquiry into South Africa's violence-plagued mining industry on Tuesday, as another miner was killed in fighting at a gold mine southwest of Johannesburg.</p>
<p>Mine management told state radio the 33-year-old worker was stabbed to death in a fight at East Driefontein, a division of Driefontein Consolidated Ltd. They gave no reason for the latest flare-up of violence.</p>
<p>At least 25 miners have been killed and scores injured in recent weeks in fights on four mines run by Gold Fields of South Africa Ltd.</p>
<p>The violence has hit output at the affected three gold mines, including East Driefontein, and one platinum operation.</p>
<p>Gold Fields has attributed the violence to clashes between the 350,000-strong National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) which has a largely Xhosa membership and the smaller United Workers' Union of South Africa, aligned to the Zulu-led Inkatha Freedom Party.</p>
<p>&quot;We are extremely concerned,&quot; Mboweni told a Cape Town news conference after talks with NUM President James Motlatsi and Deputy Mineral Affairs Minister Susan Shabangu on Tuesday. The meeting was requested by Motlatsi.</p>
<p>Mboweni said he had also discussed the violence with Gold Fields head of gold mining Alan Munro, who had been &quot;very cooperative&quot;, and would meet police minister Sydney Mufamadi on Wednesday.</p>
<p>South Africa's mining industry was built on a labour system whereby men left their wives and families for months at a time to work on the mines.</p>
<p>Mine hostels were largely segregated on ethnic lines, with Zulus, Xhosas or Basotho each in separate quarters.</p>
<p>Motlatsi told reporters he had proposed to Mboweni that a comprehensive commission of inquiry be instituted to deal with the migrant labour system and &quot;the command structure&quot; on mines.</p>
<p>&quot;The mining industry is the founder of apartheid, was a pillar of apartheid, so we need to look at that pillar to see how we make it possible to move towards the direction of democracy,&quot; the union leader said.</p>
<p>Mboweni said he favoured the proposal and would discuss it with cabinet colleagues. &quot;I think it's important. Why is it that segregation along ethnic lines still exists? What is it that causes these fights to take an ethnic dimension?</p>
<p>&quot;...If the government agrees to it I think it would be good to proceed with it as soon as possible.</p>
<p>&quot;It is quite clear that some of the root causes of this violence are historical and in a sense some of the chickens are coming home to roost at the wrong time when now there is a democratic government,&quot; Mboweni said.</p>
