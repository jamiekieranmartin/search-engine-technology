<p>At least 18 miners were hurt in violence at a gold mine southwest of Johannesburg at the weekend, police said on Sunday.</p>
<p>Twenty-seven men were also arrested during the fighting among workers from two hostel blocks at Gold Fields of South Africa Ltd's East Driefontein mine, a division of Driefontein Consolidated Ltd, on Saturday.</p>
<p>Police said they would be charged with public violence, and would appear in court on Monday.</p>
<p>A revolver, 15 rounds of ammunition and about 500 home-made weapons were seized when police broke up the clash.</p>
<p>Since July, at least 20 miners have died in feuding at Gold Fields' East Driefontein and Kloof Gold Mining Co mines.</p>
<p>Gold Fields has attributed the violence to clashes between members of the 350,000-strong National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), which has a largely Xhosa membership on the mine, and the smaller, Zulu-led United Workers' Union of South Africa (Uwusa).</p>
<p>Production has also been affected by the violence. East Driefontein workers staged a five-day stayaway at the end of August, only returning to work on September 2.</p>
<p>Dries produced 11,680.6 kg of gold in the three months to end-June. Kloof produced 9,877.7 kg of gold in the June quarter.</p>
<p>Labour Minister Tito Mboweni has backed an NUM call for a wide-ranging inquiry into violence in South Africa's mining industry, and plans to ask the cabinet for approval to go ahead.</p>
<p>South Africa's mining industry was built on a labour system whereby men left their wives and families for months at a time to work on the mines. Mine hostels were largely segregated on ethnic lines with Zulus, Xhosas or Basotho in separate quarters.</p>
