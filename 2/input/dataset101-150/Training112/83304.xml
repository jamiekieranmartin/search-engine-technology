<p>One woman was killed and four people were injured when a car ploughed into a group of spectators at the 24th Rothmans Cyprus Rally late on Friday, police said on Saturday.</p>
<p>Police said a 24-year-old woman was killed and four people were injured, two critically, when one of the cars taking part in the 950-km (590-mile) run veered off a dirt track some 20 km (12 miles) southwest of Nicosia and plunged into them.</p>
<p>&quot;It is the first time something like this has happened,&quot; said one of the rally organisers. The driver, Cypriot Marios Politas, dropped out of the event.</p>
<p>The accident occurred a few hours after the rally, one of the major sporting events in Cyprus, started in the capital Nicosia. The rally is due to end on Sunday afternoon.</p>
