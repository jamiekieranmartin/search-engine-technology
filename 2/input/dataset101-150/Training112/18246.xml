<title>AUSTRIA: Three seriously hurt in Austria train accident.</title>
<headline>Three seriously hurt in Austria train accident.</headline>
<dateline>LINZ, Austria 1996-08-28</dateline>

<p>A passenger train collided with a locomotive at a main railway station in Linz on Wednesday, injuring around 35 people, three of them seriously, police said.</p>
<p>&quot;One locomotive was stationary and the passenger train collided into the back of it,&quot; a police spokesman in Linz, 200 km (120 miles) west of Vienna, told Reuters by telephone.</p>
<p>The express passenger train travelling from Steyr, southeast of Linz, had around 80 people on board when it hit the back of a service locomotive used to shunt wagons into sidings.</p>
<p>Police said they were checking whether one of the train drivers had ignored a signal.</p>
<p>Doctors and medical staff from a hospital across the road from the station were at the scene of the accident within minutes and treated some of the injured near the tracks.</p>
<p>The collision took place on a bridge leading into the station and firemen used cranes to lift the injured on stretchers from the bridge to the road below.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Linz emergency accident unit, just 20 metres (yards) from the station, said most of the injured were only slightly hurt but three had to remain in hospital. Their injuries were not life-threatening, he said.</p>
<p>Austria's state railway (OeBB) said greater damage was averted as the driver of the passenger train had time to apply his emergency brakes before the collision.</p>
<p>The OeBB estimated damage at 10 million schillings (one million dollars) and said it had launched an inquiry into the accident.</p>
