<p>At least five people were injured when an Amtrak passenger train slammed into an empty logging truck and derailed early on Tuesday, officials said.</p>
<p>The Vermonter, which runs between St. Albans, Vermont, near the Canadian border and Washington, D.C., collided with the truck at 7:51 a.m. EDT near the rural town of Roxbury some 15 miles southeast of the state capital Montpelier, Amtrak spokeswoman Maureen Garrity said.</p>
<p>Vermont Central Hospital spokesman Dan Pudvah said five people, including the truck driver, were brought to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>&quot;The truck driver has been treated and released,&quot; Pudvah said. &quot;Another passenger, a woman, who had been brought in earlier this morning, has also been released and we expect that the three others will be released later in the day.&quot;</p>
<p>The train's engine and its six cars derailed but were still standing, state police said. The exact number of passangers was not known. &quot;We had 70 reservations for the train, but that doesn't mean there were 70 passengers aboard,&quot; Garrity said.</p>
<p>Uninjured passengers were to be taken by bus to Springfield, Massachusetts, where they will be put aboard another train to continue their journey to New York City and Washington, Garrity said.</p>
<p>She said the train was traveling at 54 mph when it crashed into the truck, which was crossing the tracks onto a dirt road in the rural area bordering the Northfield Mountains.</p>
