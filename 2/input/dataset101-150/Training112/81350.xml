<p>Nine people, four adults and five children were killed on Friday when a 10-metre (30-foot) cliff collapsed on a school group at a popular surfing beach in Western Australia, police said.</p>
<p>All members of the group of 25 or so children, teachers and other adults had now been accounted for and excavation work had been completed, Australian Broadcasting Corp radio reported.  </p>
<p>The accident happened at about 3 p.m. (0700 GMT) near the Cowaramup National Park about 200 km (120 miles) southwest of Perth, capital of the state of Western Australia.</p>
<p>&quot;We've completed excavations and we don't expect to find anyone else,&quot; police spokesman Tony Potts told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't expect the death toll to go any higher,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>One young girl was injured in the collapse but her injuries were not life-threatening, he said. The children in the group, from two local schools, were aged 11 to 13.</p>
