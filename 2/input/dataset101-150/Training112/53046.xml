<p>At least 24 pupils were killed and 98 injured in a stampede after an accident on a narrow bridge to their school in southwestern China, officials said on Friday.</p>
<p>The tragedy at the Nanping primary school in southwestern Yunnan province occurred early on September 9 as about 1,000 children were filing over an elevated walkway to the school, a local official said.</p>
<p>At least 24 children died after several of the pupils, aged between 10 and 12, tripped at the bottom of the steps, the official said. Others fell on top of them and dozens were crushed when hundreds behind them were pushed forward in the resulting surge.</p>
<p>The official said 98 children were injured, including 17 listed in serious condition in hospital. Several were in critical condition, he said.</p>
