<p>Seventeen children were killed on Thursday when a locomotive struck a school bus at a level crossing in Russia's southern Rostov region, the Ministry for Emergency Situations said.</p>
<p>Accidents on unguarded crossings are common in Russia.</p>
<p>The ministry said the group of children aged 10 to 15 was on the way to school in the village of Kagalnitskaya about 30 km (20 miles) out of Rostov-on-Don.</p>
<p>Fifteen were killed immediately and two died later in hospital. Fourteen children and three adults hurt in the accident were treated in a local hospital.</p>
<p>The ministry said that a team of doctors was on stand-by to fly to the region if local hospitals needed assistance.</p>
