<p>Russia observed a day of mourning on Saturday for the funerals of 21 people, mostly children killed this week when a locomotive hit their school bus on a level crossing in the southern Rostov region.</p>
<p>State radio and television and played sombre music and a news bulletin showed photographs of some of children and then showed the message: &quot;Russia remembers, Russia mourns&quot;.</p>
<p>Television showed families of the victims leaning over their open coffins and sobbing as they kissed their children for the last time. They were buried in mass funerals in two different villages, the only local priest travelling between the two.</p>
<p>Eleven people are being treated in intensive care, Itar-Tass news agency said.</p>
<p>President Boris Yeltsin's younger daughter Tatyana visited the area on Friday and spoke with some of the injured and the relatives of the victims.</p>
<p>It was one of her first public engagements on behalf of her father, who is in hospital preparing for heart surgery.</p>
<p>&quot;In one family two little girls died, as I understand the only children in the family. As a mother I think it must be impossible to live through that,&quot; she said on Friday night.</p>
<p>The Emergency Situations Ministry said the group of children aged 10 to 15 was on the way to school in the village of Kagalnitskaya about 30 km (20 miles) out of Rostov-on-Don when the train hit their bus on the crossing. Accidents on unguarded crossings are common in Russia.</p>
<p>In the nearby town of Rostov-on-Don black ribbons have been pinned to national flags on public buildings buses are carrying black flags and bells are tolling, Itar-Tass news agency said.</p>
<p>Russian Public Television supended all advertising for the day and Russian Television cancelled its light entertainment and childrens' programmes.</p>
