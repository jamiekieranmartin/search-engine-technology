<p>Fifteen people were injured when a suburban passenger train and a truck collided at a street-level rail crossing in the Australian city of Melbourne on Monday, said rail and ambulance officials.</p>
<p>The injured, which included a pregnant woman, were taken to hospital, but were not in a serious condition, an ambulance spokesman told Reuters.</p>
<p>A Public Transport Corporation spokesman said the train, collided with the truck loaded with concrete pylons in the north Melbourne suburb of Preston just before 8.30 a.m..</p>
<p>The train was derailed when a corner of the driver's compartment caught the rear of the truck, the spokesman said.</p>
<p>The truck was overturned, spilling its load onto the crossing, and careered into the nearby Bell St Station.</p>
<p>&quot;Remarkably both the train driver and the truck driver were not injured,&quot; the rail spokesman said.</p>
<p>&quot;It had the potential to be quite a nasty accident.&quot;</p>
