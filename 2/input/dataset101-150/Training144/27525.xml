<p>Three missing climbers, two Britons and a New Zealander, have died in an avalanche high on a mountain in northern Pakistan, officials said on Monday.</p>
<p>A Pakistani official in the northern town of Gilgit said the climbers, whom he identified as Stephen Thornley, 25, and Andrew Boas, 24, both British, and Christopher Hoare, a New Zealander, had died on August 12 in the Shamshal Valley on the 7,885-metre (25,869-foot) peak of Disteghil Sar.</p>
<p>He said death certificates for the three men had been issued on Sunday, though no bodies had been recovered.</p>
<p>A British diplomat said he could not confirm that the missing climbers were dead. He said all three men were British, although Boas might hold dual nationality.</p>
<p>Three other climbers from the same expedition, all New Zealanders, set off by road from Gilgit for Islamabad, where they were expected to arrive late on Monday or on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The six men arrived in Pakistan in June and told a local newspaper that they aimed to climb Disteghil Sar by a previously unattempted route.</p>
<p>According to a Pakistani liaison officer, the team left their base camp on July 8 to attempt the climb. They later split into two groups for a final ascent by different routes.</p>
<p>One group, which had tried a rocky route to the summit, returned to Camp Three in bad weather on August 12.</p>
<p>The surviving climbers, named as Thomas Davies, Dominic Harmond and Peter Marriott, said they had seen their companions, who were attempting a snow- and ice-covered route, through a long camera lens the same day, but then did not see them again.</p>
<p>They climbed back up to Camp Two and waited there until August 23, returning to Base Camp on August 26. They arrived in Gilgit, 280 km (175 miles) north of Islamabad, on August 31.</p>
