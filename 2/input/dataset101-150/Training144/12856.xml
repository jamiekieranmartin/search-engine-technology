<p>Some 84 pilgrims have died from exposure in the Himalayan mountains along a rugged route to a 3,880-metre (12,725-ft) high cave, officials said on Saturday.</p>
<p>Nearly 70,000 pilgrims were stranded by heavy rain and snow and authorities in Kashmir have suspended the annual Hindu pilgrimage, the officials said.  </p>
<p>The trek through India's only Moslem majority state began last week and had been scheduled to end next Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;At least 84 pilgrims have died of cold so far,&quot; said K.B. Jandial, a spokesman for Jammu and Kashmir state. &quot;We have suspended the movement of pilgrims who are stranded at different places in the state.&quot;</p>
<p>The spokesman said the pilgrimage had not been cancelled but could not say when it might be resumed.</p>
<p>Officials said some 112,000 Hindus had arrived in Kashmir this year to visit the Amarnath cave, where devotees worship an ice stalagmite believed to be a manifestation of the &quot;lingam&quot;, or phallus, of the Hindu god Shiva.</p>
