<p>The death toll from Typhoon Sally, which slammed into southern China this week, has climbed to 133, officials and state media said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The typhoon also left 190 missing after slicing across Guangdong province on Monday and neighbouring Guangxi province the next day.</p>
<p>&quot;We have 100 seriously injured here...The death toll is likely to rise,&quot; an official of Maoming city in Guangdong told Reuters by telephone.</p>
<p>The death toll in Maoming rose by three to 36 on Wednesday, officials said, adding that at least 79 people were killed in worst-hit neighbouring Zhanjiang city.</p>
<p>In Guangxi, at least 16 people were killed and 160 injured, the China News Service said.</p>
<p>Officials in Guangdong's Yangjiang city reported at least two dead.</p>
<p>Hundreds of fishing boats either sank or were damaged. Economic losses in Maoming and Zhanjiang alone were estimated at 12.8 billion yuan ($1.5 billion), local officials said.</p>
<p>Soldiers and paramilitary police had been deployed to help with rescue work in Zhanjiang, where almost all trees in the city and its suburbs had been uprooted by the storm's fierce winds.</p>
<p>Rail and highway traffic had been suspended. Water supplies and electricity were cut off but in some areas had been restored by Wednesday morning, officials said.</p>
<p>The typhoon follows floods that swept across central and southern China in July, killing at least 2,700 people and leaving hundreds of thousands homeless, according to the latest official figures.</p>
