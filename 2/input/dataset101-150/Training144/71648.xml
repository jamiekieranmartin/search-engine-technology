<p>The death toll from Typhoon Willie, which slammed into China's southern island province of Hainan last week, has climbed to 14, officials said on Monday.</p>
<p>About 11 people were killed in Wenchang county, an official told Reuters by telephone, but declined to give further details.</p>
<p>Two people were killed and 25 injured in Haikou, capital of Hainan, state media has said.</p>
<p>In Xiongshan county, the typhoon electrocuted one person and caused losses worth 500 million yuan ($60.2 million), a local official said.</p>
<p>About 26,700 people were marooned by floods when about 100 metres (328 ft) of dykes were washed away in Xiongshan county, the official said.</p>
<p>&quot;The storm is the worst to hit the county in 20 years,&quot; he said, adding about 20 military vessels had been deployed to rescue fishermen.</p>
<p>The typhoon injured eight people in Xuwen county in neighbouring Guangdong province last week and caused economic losses worth 800 million yuan ($96.4 million), a local official said.</p>
<p>In Hanoi, meteorological officials said Willie had weakened to a tropical low pressure after it landed in Vietnam's northern and north central provinces on Sunday evening.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Typhoon Sally killed at least 133 people when it thrashed southern provinces of China's Guangdong and Guangxi.</p>
<p>Floods that swept across central and southern China in July killed at least 2,700 people and left hundreds of thousands homeless.</p>
