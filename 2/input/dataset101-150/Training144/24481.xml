<p>Accident investigators working on an Arctic mountain recovered a flight recorder from the snowbound wreck of a Russian airliner on Friday, hoping it could help explain the disaster in which 141 people died.</p>
<p>The Tupolev Tu-154 bringing Russian and Ukrainian coal miners to work on the remote island of Spitzbergen crashed into the mountain on Thursday as it was about to land, killing all those on board.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the island governor's office said the flight data recorder had been found, containing vital information about the height and speed of the plane when it crashed.</p>
<p>But Norwegian investigators told a news conference later it could be either the data recorder or another device from the plane recording the pilots' voices and communications.</p>
<p>The shockproof orange box, found buried in snow near the remains of the plane's tail section, could tell Norwegian and Russian investigators whether the plane was off course or flying too low -- if the data inside has not been damaged.</p>
<p>It will be taken to Moscow for detailed examination.</p>
<p>A team of police, investigators and doctors also began the perilous, grisly task of recovering bodies from the crash site. They were flown there by helicopter on Friday, 24 hours after the crash, once a break in bad weather allowed them to move in.</p>
<p>&quot;We are digging the dead out of the snow,&quot; deputy governor Rune Baard Hansen told reporters.</p>
<p>Tore Dahlberg, a doctor who went to the scene, told Norwegian television the wreck area was &quot;a terrible sight&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;We saw the mangled remains of people in the wreckage,&quot; he said. Getting the bodies down from the mountain is a priority.</p>
<p>&quot;The first thing is that the dead will be counted and tagged. Then the victims will be bagged, sent by helicopter to Longyear and afterwards flown to Tromsoe (in mainland Norway) for autopsy,&quot; said police coordinator Ivar Follestad.</p>
<p>Most of the three-engined plane, smashed and broken, is stranded on a mountaintop some seven km (four miles) east of Longyear. The tail section broke off and slid down the steep mountainside, scarring the surface and blackening the snow.</p>
<p>The windblown, chilly streets of this tiny Norwegian mining town were all but deserted and flags flew at half-mast beneath a brooding, clouded sky on Friday.</p>
<p>The close-knit, hardy Norwegian and Russian mining communities on the island were plunged into grief and shock by the worst air disaster in Norway's history.</p>
<p>The island's governor, Ann-Kristin Olsen, choked back tears as she told reporters of the heartbreak she witnessed when visiting the stricken Russian mining communities on Friday.</p>
<p>The miners were on their way to start work in the Russian towns of Barentsburg and Pyramiden. Fewer than 3,000 people live on Spitzbergen, which has one of the world's harshest climates and lies some 500 miles (800 km) off the northern tip of Norway.</p>
<p>The crash site is inaccessible by land and there is a danger of avalanches and from polar bears which roam Spitzbergen's icy wastes, rescue officials said.</p>
<p>Officials said it could days or weeks to bring all the bodies down from the mountain. Police said mountain climbers could be needed to reach the tail section of the plane.</p>
<p>The Tupolev Tu-154 was bringing miners and some of their families, 76 of them from Ukraine, to work in a Russian open-cast mine. Spitzbergen is governed by Norway but Russia has rights of access under an international treaty from the 1920s.</p>
<p>In Kiev, Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma declared Friday a national day of mourning for the dead miners and their families.</p>
