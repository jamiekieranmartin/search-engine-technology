<p>Britain, backed by the United States, on Tuesday offered a Security Council resolution that would condemn Iraq's offensive against the Kurds and also call for Iran to stop its involvement in northern Iraq.</p>
<p>But Russia's envoy, Sergei Lavrov, angrily served notice that he would oppose the measure, saying the council should call on all to refrain from using force, including the United States, Iraq and Iran. He also opposed U.S. suggestions that a limited oil sales plan for Iraq be delayed for months.</p>
<p>&quot;The response to this event by the United States was disproportionate and is not an acceptable response. It does not flow from the resolutions of the Security Council if one cares to read those resolutions,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The British draft would condemn Iraq's offensive in the north, call for a return to previous positions, ask Iran also to stop its interference and request the feuding Kurdish factions to resume talks.</p>
<p>Iraq said it sent troops to its northern territory to block Iran, which earlier had sent a smaller number of forces to northern Iraq to help one Kurdish faction.</p>
<p>France and China also were cool to the British text, and no immediate action was expected in the Security Council. Egyptian diplomats questioned why there was no mention in the draft of the U.S. attack.</p>
<p>Any action in the council would be based on resolution 688, adopted in 1991, which condemned the repression of Iraqi minorities at the end of the Gulf War. But this measure deliberately excluded the use of force and did not set up any no-flight zones as the United States has maintained.</p>
<p>Separately, the U.S. deputy representative, Edward Gnehm, a Middle East expert, said the oil-for-food plan that would allow Iraq to sell $2 billion worth of petroleum over six months to buy food and medicine might be delayed for &quot;months and months&quot; and might have to be reconsidered.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a matter of going back to the (accord) and looking at it,&quot; he said. &quot;It was a designed program and those conditions don't exist anymore.&quot;</p>
<p>Lavrov, however, said implementation of the program was up to Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who should continue working toward putting it in effect &quot;bearing in mind the safety of international personnel.&quot;</p>
<p>Asked about Gnehm's statements, Lavrov said: &quot;So what? There are no limits to what one can demand. But I think the (accord) is between the United Nations and Iraq.&quot;</p>
<p>Boutros-Ghali postponed sending monitors to Iraq to implement the plan after Iraq's action in the north, saying he was concerned about U.N. personnel. The program is to ease the impact of six years of trade sanctions for civilians.</p>
<p>The oil-for-food accord is an exemption from overall sanctions imposed in August 1990 when Iraq invaded Kuwait. The Security Council, as expected, made no change on Tuesday in the stiff economic sanctions.</p>
<p>The council decision was made during a review of the sanctions conducted every 60 days, and was not directly related to Iraq's weekend attack.</p>
<p>A prime condition for any easing is a clean bill of health from the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) in charge of scrapping Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.</p>
<p>UNSCOM chief Rolf Ekeus, who briefed the council on a recent trip to Baghdad, told reporters he was still far from satisfied Iraq had made full disclosure, citing shortcomings in the areas of long-range missiles, chemical and biological programs and related documents.</p>
<p>He again said Iraq had not accounted for all its ballistic missiles, saying he was missing documentation on between six and 16 missiles.</p>
