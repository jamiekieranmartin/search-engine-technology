<p>U.N. weapons inspectors have grounded their surveillance helicopters in iraq because of the confrontation between Baghdad and the United States, thereby putting on hold some of their sensitive work.</p>
<p>Rolf Ekeus, head of the U.N. Special Commission in charge of ridding Iraq of weapons of mass destruction, told a news conference: &quot;We have grounded all air operaltions for the time being. Our people are still in Baghdad but we can't carry out sensitive operations...becasue of the (current situation.).  </p>
<p>Ekeus said that the new no-flight zone imposed by the United States shortly after it unleashed cruise missiles against targets in southern Iraq,  now reached the outskirts of Baghdad.</p>
<p>&quot;We have two sides which are facing each other. We are aware these are no ordinary times so I don't want them to fly,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said he had about 104 inspectors and support staff in Baghdad and all had been told to stay in radio contract in case of emergencies.</p>
<p>The lack of helicopters, he said, would hinder his inspections of sites where Iraq might still be hiding weapons because of the lack of air surveillance to spot any movement.</p>
<p>&quot;The search for sensitive items must be kept on hold,&quot; he said, repeating that &quot;We suspect that Iraq is having an active policy of concealment of these prohibited items.&quot;</p>
