<p>An outbreak of encephalitis has killed at least 115 people in 15 districts in Nepal in last five months, a government official said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;A total of 624 people have been affected by the disease,&quot; Benu Bahadur Karki, head of Nepal's epidemiology department told Reuters while confirming a report published in the state-owned daily Gorkhapatra.</p>
<p>The newspaper said the disease was caused by mosquitoes and had mainly affected districts of Jhapa, Morang, Rupandehi and Banke, all bordering with India.</p>
<p>Banke in west Nepal with 25 victims was worst hit.</p>
<p>A patient affected by encephalitis germs usually suffers from high fever, severe headaches and drowsiness and dies in five days, doctors said.</p>
<p>Karki said the authorities were helpless as there was no special drug for the disease and hospitals outside the capital, Kathmandu, were ill-equipped to counter the epidemic.</p>
