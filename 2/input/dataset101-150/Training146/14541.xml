<p>The U.N. envoy in charge of dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction arrived in Baghdad on Monday for talks with Iraqi officials on the disputed issue of access and other disarmament topics, U.N. sources in the Iraqi capital said.</p>
<p>One source said the envoy, Rolf Ekeus, would hold talks with Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz during his three day visit.</p>
<p>Ekeus, head of the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) on Iraq, is expected to raise the subject of the latest Iraqi obstruction of his arms inspectors and demand once again that Baghdad give them unrestricted access to any site they wish to inspect.</p>
<p>The visit is the second by Ekeus in about two months. In June the two sides agreed to hold periodic meetings to accelerate implementation of the 1991 Gulf War ceasefire terms, requiring that Iraq rid itself of nuclear, chemical, and biological arms as well as its stocks of long-range missiles.</p>
<p>The Security Council asked Iraq on Friday to stop blocking searches by Ekeus's inspectors for concealed weapons at any site they deemed necessary.</p>
<p>In June, Aziz and Ekeus defused a crisis over access. Baghdad agreed to allow U.N. inspectors into all sites including those it regarded as crucial to national sovereignty provided the experts respected Iraqi national concerns during visits.</p>
<p>But Iraq balked at several surprise inspections by UNSCOM teams later. The latest obstruction took place last week when the Iraqis barred a small group of U.N. monitors from entering a storage area they suspected of holding banned material.</p>
<p>Ekeus was not available for comment as Iraqi officials took him to a government guest house immediately after his arrival.</p>
<p>Another U.N. source said the envoy was accompanied by Nikita Smidovich, a Russian ballistic missile expert who led most of the inspection teams that ran into trouble with the Iraqis over access to sensitive sites.</p>
<p>The removal of the curbs on Iraqi oil exports, other than limited amounts allowed under a deal Baghdad signed with U.N. last June, relies to a large extent on a report by Ekeus testifying full compliance by Baghdad.</p>
<p>Ekeus said last week that Iraq still needed to come clean on its banned weapons and maintained that some materials were still missing.</p>
<p>Iraq says it has done all that it is required to do to have the ban on its oil exports completely lifted.</p>
