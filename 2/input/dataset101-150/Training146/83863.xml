<p>A senior United Nations weapons inspector arrived in Iraq on Sunday for talks with Iraqi officials on efforts to eliminate Baghdad's biological and chemical weapons.</p>
<p>Charles Duelfer, deputy chairman of the UN Special Commission (UNSCOM) charged with scrapping Iraq's weapons of mass destruction under terms of the 1991 Gulf War ceasefire, said the commission still faced obstacles in talks with Baghdad.</p>
<p>&quot;We continue to have problems with the resolution of the past programmes, and that has been the focus of our work for the past several months now,&quot; Duelfer told reporters.</p>
<p>In June Iraq blocked UN access to Republican or Presidential Guard sites that Iraq said were sensitive for its own security and sovereignty.</p>
<p>UNSCOM's head Rolf Ekeus later reached agreement with Iraqi authorities for unconditional access for UN weapons inspectors but said he believed Iraq was still concealing banned arms.</p>
<p>Duelfer said he planned an &quot;overall discussion of the relationship between the commission and the government of Iraq,&quot; ahead of UNSCOM's report to the U.N. Security Council early next month.</p>
<p>&quot;We have just finished a series of inspections...we will reflect on those and then make our plans accordingly,&quot; he said. &quot;This is not part of an inspection.&quot;</p>
<p>Duelfer said he would meet General Amer al-Saadi, adviser at the presidential office and Oil Minister Amir Muhammad Rasheed, former head of Iraq's Military Industrialization Commission.</p>
<p>A clean bill of health by UNSCOM is key to lifting the ban on Iraqi oil exports imposed in 1990 after Iraq invaded Kuwait. UNSCOM activities are not linked to the stalled oil-for-food deal which would allow Iraq to export $2 billion of oil to buy food and medicine.</p>
