<title>UNITED NATIONS: Security Council retains sanctions against Iraq.</title>
<headline>Security Council retains sanctions against Iraq.</headline>
<dateline>UNITED NATIONS 1996-09-03</dateline>

<p>The Security Council made no change on Tuesday in stiff economic sanctions, including a ban on oil sales, imposed on Iraq since its August 1990 invasion of Kuwait.</p>
<p>The council decision was made during a regular review of the curbs conducted every 60 days. It was not directly related to Iraq's weekend attack on a Kurdish-held area in the north of the country which drew a response early Tuesday from the United States in the form of missile strikes against targets in southern Iraq.  </p>
<p>But even without Iraq's lunge into the Kurdish area, where the United States and its Western allies have maintained a no-fly zone since the end of the Gulf War, the council would still have retained the sanctions intact.</p>
<p>A prime condition for any easing is a clean bill of health from the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) in charge of scrapping Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.</p>
<p>UNSCOM chief Rolf Ekeus, who briefed the council on a recent trip to Iraq, told reporters he was still far from satisfied that Baghdad had made a full disclosure, citing shortcomings in the areas of missiles, chemical and biological programmes and related documents.</p>
<p>&quot;Iraq has not accounted for the missile capability fully,&quot; he said, adding that between six and 16 were unaccounted for.</p>
