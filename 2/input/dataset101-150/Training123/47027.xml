<p>British national newspaper publisher Mirror Group Plc posted a small profit increase on Wednesday in the face of a large jump in newsprint costs.</p>
<p>Pre-tax profit before exceptional items in the first six months of the year rose by 2.9 percent to 39.0 million pounds ($60.59 million).</p>
<p>Interim dividend was increased to 1.35p from 1.2p.</p>
<p>Initial market reaction was positive, Mirror shares adding seven to 208.5p by 0845 GMT.</p>
<p>&quot;Mirror Group has outperformed other newspaper companies in absorbing a 35 percent increase in newsprint costs, maintaining high levels of marketing investment in the brands and still producing an increase in profits,&quot; chief executive David Montgomery said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;The quality of these results confirms Mirror Group as an efficiently run media business now capable of further expansion by deploying its core skills,&quot; Montgomery added.</p>
<p>Mirror Group's flagship title is the tabloid Daily Mirror, Britain's second-top selling newspaper. It also has a major stake in The Independent broadsheet and has recently branched out into cable television.</p>
<p>The costs of newsprint -- the material on which newspapers are printed -- rose by 18 million pounds year-on-year but Mirror said it had largely managed to off-set this through higher advertising and circulation revenues.</p>
<p>Finance Director John Allwood said that cover price rises had helped to boost circulation revenue by 11 million pounds while advertising revenue was up by around five million.</p>
<p>With newsprint price now levelling off, Allwood said that the company would now seek to win new readers with special supplements to its core titles.</p>
<p>The Mirror's Television arm had losses of 4.2 million pounds, stemming from start-up costs at its Live TV local cable service.</p>
<p>Live TV's offbeat style, including programmes such as topless darts, has earned it hefty criticism but Allwood said this was undeserved.</p>
<p>&quot;It is now receivable in 1.45 million homes and I think people should stop knocking us and give us a bit more credit,&quot; he said, adding 60-70 main brand companies advertised on Live.</p>
<p>The channel is currently available in central London and Birmingham but launches are planned in the cities of Liverpool and Edinburgh by the end of the year.</p>
