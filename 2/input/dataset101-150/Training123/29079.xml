<dateline>LONDON 1996-09-03</dateline>

<p>Britain's Express Newspapers, seeking to halt a long-term sales decline, announced plans Tuesday to shed around 85 jobs as it puts its Daily and Sunday Express national titles under a single editorial team.</p>
<p>Express Newspapers, part of the recently enlarged United News &amp; Media empire, said it would invest around 10 million British pounds ($15.6 million) in an effort to improve the quality of the two ailing newspapers.</p>
<p>The planned job cuts will cost around 6 million pounds ($9.3 million) in charges, an Express spokesman said.</p>
<p>The Daily Express has average sales of around 1.2 million copies, a far cry from its heyday in the 1960s, when it had circulation of over four million and could boast with some justification of being &quot;The Voice of Britain.&quot;</p>
<p>The Daily Mail, its rival in the mid-market area, sells more than two million copies daily.</p>
<p>Express Newspapers plans to offer colour supplements on Saturdays and Sundays, plus a seven-day-a-week pull-out sports section. The number of pages in the titles will be increased and more of them will be in colour.</p>
<p>The establishment of a single editorial team is intended to make the changes easier to implement and to maximize cross readership of the two newspapers. The Sunday title also sells just over 1.2 million copies.</p>
<p>There had been speculation that the company might seek to divest its national titles following its merger earlier this year with MAI Plc, the television and financial services group.</p>
<p>United News also owns the down-market Daily Star. The Star is unaffected by the changes.</p>
