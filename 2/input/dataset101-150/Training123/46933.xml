<p>British national newspaper publisher Mirror Group Plc defied a steep rise in newsprint costs to post a small profit increase Wednesday.</p>
<p>Pre-tax profit before exceptional items in the first six months of the year rose by 2.9 percent to 39 million pounds ($60.6 million). This came despite an increase of 18 million pounds ($28 million) in the cost of newsprint.</p>
<p>&quot;Mirror Group has outperformed other newspaper companies in absorbing a 35 percent increase in newsprint costs, maintaining high levels of marketing investment in the brands and still producing an increase in profits,&quot; Chief Executive David Montgomery said.</p>
<p>&quot;The quality of these results confirms Mirror Group as an efficiently run media business now capable of further expansion by deploying its core skills,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Mirror Group's flagship title is the tabloid Daily Mirror, Britain's second-biggest selling newspaper. It also has a major stake in The Independent broadsheet and has recently branched out into cable television.</p>
<p>Finance Director John Allwood said that cover price rises had helped to boost circulation revenue by 11 million pounds ($17 million), while advertising revenue was up by around five million ($7.7 million).</p>
<p>The group said its annual newsprint bill could climb as high as 131 million pounds ($204 million) in 1996, an increase of 20 million pounds ($31 million), and noted that the pricing trend remained uncertain.</p>
