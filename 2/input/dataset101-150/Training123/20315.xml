<p>Press baron Conrad Black's holding company, Hollinger Inc., on Tuesday posted flat second-quarter results, mainly reflecting high newsprint costs.</p>
<p>Hollinger reported net earnings for the second quarter of C$7.1 million ($5.2 million U.S.), or 6 cents Canadian (4 cents) per share, compared with C$7.3 million ($5.3 million), or 6 cents Canadian (4 cents) a share, in the same period last year.</p>
<p>Before unusual items, earnings were virtually unchanged at C$10.0 million ($7.3 million) in 1996 compared to C$9.9 million ($7.2 million) in 1995.</p>
<p>The soaring cost of newsprint for publications Hollinger owned in 1995 and 1996 cut net earnings by C$9.0 million ($6.6 million). But the company said newsprint prices have been easing recently and prices paid in June were comparable to those from a year earlier.</p>
<p>The benefit from the decline in prices will be more pronounced in the second half of 1996, Hollinger said.</p>
<p>Black, whose holdings include Telegraph newspapers in London, the Chicago Sun-Times, the Jerusalem Post and a 25 percent stake in Australia's John Fairfax Holdings Inc., bought control of Canada's largest newspaper group, Southam Inc. earlier this year.</p>
<p>Hollinger's earnings, excluding foreign currency adjustments and before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) rose by 40 percent to C$84.3 million ($61.7 million) in 1996 from C$60.5 million ($44.3 million). EBITDA is a common yardstick used by financial analysts to judge a company's results.</p>
<p>The improvement in EBITDA is chiefly due to higher circulation revenue at The Daily Telegraph following the end of the newspaper price war in the United Kingdom with Rupert Murdoch's The Times newspaper. It is also a result of acquisitions made since the second quarter of 1995.</p>
