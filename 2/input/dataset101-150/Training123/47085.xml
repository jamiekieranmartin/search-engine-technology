<p>Ireland's Independent Newspapers Plc said on Wednesday that a strong performance from all its businesses helped boost first half pre-tax profit by 28 percent to a record 26.02 million punts ($41.8 million).</p>
<p>The media group, flagship company of Irish businessman and H.J. Heinz Co chief executive Tony O'Reilly, has operations in Ireland, Britain, France, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.</p>
<p>Independent, which prints and publishes more than 12 million newspapers a week, saw half-year turnover rise by nine percent to 182.5 million punts.</p>
<p>&quot;We are very, very pleased with the results,&quot; chief executive Liam Healy told Reuters.</p>
<p>The group's Irish operations, which recorded a 35 percent rise in operating profit to 16.29 million punts, benefited from circulation gains and strong advertising income.</p>
<p>In Britain, the results of Newspaper Publishing were broadly in line with expectations and represented a significant improvement on 1995, Independent said in a statement.</p>
<p>Independent and Mirror Group each hold a 46 percent stake in Newspaper Publishing which reported a loss of seven million pounds in the first half.</p>
<p>The Irish group said it hoped to see Newspaper Publishing, publisher of Britain's Independent and Independent on Sunday, return to profitability before the end of 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;It is progressing as we would have expected and we're still hopeful it will come out of the red and into the black. We would hope that before the end of next year it would hit the black,&quot; Healy said.</p>
<p>Overall British operating profits rose to 1.61 million from 0.82 million with turnover up 49 percent at 12.55 million.</p>
<p>In France outdoor advertising business Sirocco saw operating profits rise by 44 percent to 1.01 million against a background of continued sluggish economic growth, Independent said.</p>
<p>The group's South African operations contributed 8.23 million to operating profits, up from 6.96 million last year.</p>
<p>Operating profits at Independent's associated undertakings in Australia and New Zealand, which include Australian Provincial Newspapers Holdings and Wilson and Horton, totalled 3.51 punts against 3.61 million last year.</p>
<p>The company said its strategy was to continue to expand and develop its products in print, electronic media and outdoor advertising throughout the world.</p>
<p>&quot;Our aim remains to provide our shareholders with a stake in a range of dynamic and expanding economies where shareholder value can be built over the long term,&quot; O'Reilly said.</p>
<p>The share price was unchanged from Tuesday's close at 292 at 1200 GMT. ($1=.6218 Punt)</p>
