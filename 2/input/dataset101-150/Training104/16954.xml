<p>The sexual exploitation of children is a booming business in rich and poor countries alike, an international conference was told on Tuesday.</p>
<p>A global conference on sexual abuse of children opened in the Swedish capital as horrifying cases of alleged abuse were reported from Albania, Australia and Belgium.</p>
<p>&quot;Built on greed and the abuse of power, the commercial sexual exploitation of children has become a global, multi-billion dollar industry,&quot; said Carol Bellamy, Executive director of UNICEF.</p>
<p>&quot;This abhorrent practice takes place in virtually every country. Indeed, the business of child sexual exploitation appears to be booming and the richest countries are no exception,&quot; she told the opening session of the international conference organised to tackle the issue.</p>
<p>The Stockholm meeting, the first to bring governmental and non-governmental organisations together to discuss the subject, opened as a paedophile scandal unfolded in Belgium and an elderly Australian man was charged with 850 child sex crimes.</p>
<p>A Briton was arrested in Albania on Sunday and charged with sexually abusing two boys.</p>
<p>In Stockholm, more than 1,000 delegates will spend the next five days discussing measures to control the exploitation of children for sex, child pornography and sex tourism.</p>
<p>The conference is jointly organised by the Swedish government, the United Nations Childrens Fund (UNICEF), pressure group ECPAT (End Child Prostitution in Asia Tourism) and the NGO group on the rights of the child.</p>
<p>ECPAT chief Ron O'Grady told the conference that children were becoming casualties in the move towards globalisation.</p>
<p>&quot;When global values are determined by television and commercial market forces, children and young women end up becoming commodities to be bought and sold at whim,&quot; he told delegates.</p>
<p>&quot;It is hard to know which is the greater evil. The fact that so many children are used in commercial sex or the fact that so many male adults are willing to abuse them,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>More than one million children worldwide are reportedly forced into child prostitution, trafficked and sold for sexual purposes and used in the production of child pornography, according to UNICEF figures.</p>
<p>Growing awareness of AIDS had motivated some brothel visitors to seek younger prostitutes falsely believing that they had less chance of infecting them with HIV, O'Grady said.</p>
<p>In fact, children are more susceptible to infection due to their physical size and because they are less likely to insist on the use of condoms, he added.</p>
<p>UNICEF's Goodwill Ambassador British actor Roger Moore told Reuters that poverty was often a factor in the sexual exploitation of children -- but not the cause.</p>
<p>&quot;I do not think being poor is a reason for selling your child into prostitution because there are many poor people who do not sell their bodies or their children's bodies,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Laws can be changed. Do not wait, do it now,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Lisbet Palme, chairman of the Swedish UNICEF committee and widow of assassinated Prime Minister Olof Palme, said the horrific disclosures in Belgium had proved the importance of openness in combatting child sex abuse.</p>
<p>&quot;The most important thing is to be able to talk about the problem. Take a look at the recent tragedy in Belgium, we saw grown men crying in rage and frustration,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Belgian police investigating Marc Dutroux, suspected of running a paedophile ring, said on Monday they had arrested a 10th suspect.</p>
<p>In the rapidly-widening child sex abuse scandal, two kidnapped eight-year-old girls have been found dead, two other girls rescued and police are hunting at least two more girls who have been missing for a year.</p>
<p>A 15-strong delegation from Belgium, including Foreign Affairs Minister Erik Derycke, is attending the conference.</p>
