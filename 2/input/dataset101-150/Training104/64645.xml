<p>Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene opened a parliamentary debate about Belgium's child sex and political murder scandals with a vow that any serious errors in police investigations would be punished.</p>
<p>&quot;If it appears that during early phases of the investigation serious errors have been made, they will be sanctioned,&quot; Dehaene told a specially convened session of parliament.</p>
<p>He said the conclusions of an inquiry into the investigations in both scandals would be presented to parliament's justice commission as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Dehaene also tried to calm popular anger with the slow progress of the investigations and the government's apparent inability to reform the police and judiciary.</p>
<p>&quot;The people have lost confidence in the justice system, in the government and in the country's institutions,&quot; said Louis Michel, leader of the opposition Wallonia Liberal Party (PRL).</p>
<p>&quot;The citizens of this country are furious about the government's inability to deal with society's most urgent needs, notably a reform of the judicial system,&quot; said Patrick Dewael, faction leader of the opposition Flemish Liberal Party (VLD).</p>
<p>Dehaene said the judiciary should do its utmost to make progress in the investigation into the 1991 mafia-style murder of politician Andre Cools.</p>
<p>&quot;The investigation into the murder raised many questions and led to a general feeling of mistrust of our institutions. The judiciary now must go to the heart of the matter,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We must also wonder what we have done wrong ourselves, each of us, in politics, in the judiciary, the police, in the media, and the population in general so as to prevent a repeat of these events.&quot;</p>
<p>Faction leaders of all parties were due to take the floor during the day in the extraordinary session convened at the request of the opposition, two weeks before the parliamentary year begins.</p>
<p>Parties were expected to back the setting-up of a committee of inquiry into judicial bungling in the investigations of the Cools murder and the activities of a paedophile ring which has killed four young girls in the past year.</p>
<p>There have been allegations of cover-ups in both cases.</p>
<p>In the child sex case, police officers are suspected of having been involved in a car theft racket led by paedophile gang leader and convicted child rapist Marc Dutroux.</p>
<p>There has also been harsh criticism about lack of communication between the country's various police services. One part of the police force failed to pass crucial information about Dutroux to investigators of the child kidnappings.</p>
<p>In the case of the killing of Cools, a former Socialist minister, party-appointed investigators have attempted to divert inquiries leading to party members, judicial sources claim.</p>
<p>The police denied any wrongdoing.</p>
<p>&quot;We do not pretend that everything the Gendarmerie has done in the Dutroux case was perfect,&quot; Gendarmerie General-Major Herman Fransen told a news conference. &quot;But we have done all we could and more and have nothing to hide.&quot;</p>
<p>He added: &quot;If the Cools case has received new impetus recently it is thanks to the Gendarmerie investigating team.&quot;</p>
<p>The investigation into the Cools murder led to the discovery of high-level corruption in an army helicopters contract in the late 1980s, which triggered the resignation of four Belgian government ministers and of NATO Secretary-General Willy Claes, a Belgian former economics minister.</p>
