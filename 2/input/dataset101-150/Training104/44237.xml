<p>Tremors from the weekend arrest of a former government minister on charges of murder began spreading through the Belgian political system on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Alain Van der Biest, his former private secretary Richard Taxquet and three other men were charged with the murder near Liege on July 18, 1991 of Andre Cools, patriarch of the country's francophone Socialist Party (PS).</p>
<p>Marc Van Peel, president of the flemish Christian Democratic Party (CVP), told La Libre Belgique newspaper he would not tolerate any hint of a cover-up.</p>
<p>The CVP, its francophone sister party the PSC and the PS and its flemish sister the SP form Belgium's coalition government.</p>
<p>Ecolo and Agalev, the francophone and flemish Green Parties, have demanded a parliamentary inquiry, as has the francophone Liberal Party the PRL.</p>
<p>Paul Van Grembergen of the flemish Volksunie went even further and called for the entire Socialist Party structure to be dismantled.</p>
<p>Investigations into the murder of Cools, believed to have been on the verge of blowing the whistle on corruption in the Liege branch of the Socialist Party, have uncovered a trail of bribery and and corruption, and prompted allegations of political intrigue and interference in the judicial system.</p>
<p>La Libre Belgique speculated on Tuesday that the Cools murder was connected to rivalries between different Masonic Lodges within the Socialist Party.</p>
<p>Four Socialist government ministers have been forced to resign, an Air Force general committed suicide and NATO Secretary General Willy Claes was forced to stand down.</p>
<p>The resignations of Claes, Guy Mathot, Guy Spitaels, Guy Coeme and Frank Vandenbroucke were over bribes allegedly paid to the Socialist Parties by Italian firm Agusta in the late 1980s in return for a contract to supply helicopters to the army.</p>
<p>Claes, who was head of the SP at the time, denies any knowledge of the bribes.</p>
<p>So far the political fallout of the Cools murder has stopped short of threatening the incumbent government.</p>
<p>Indeed, in national elections last year the Socialist Party was returned with more seats. Mathot, Spitaels and Coeme were all comfortably politically rehabilitated by voters.</p>
<p>But what makes the weekend's arrests different is that the climate in the country has been thoroughly soured by separate investigations into the discovery of a child-kidnapping, sexual abuse and murder gang operating in Belgium.</p>
<p>The so-called Dutroux Affair, named after chief suspect Marc Dutroux, has disgusted the nation with its discovery of the corpses of four young girls, the rescue of two others who had been abducted and sexually abused and the hunt for at least seven others.</p>
<p>Distrust of the authorities has been deepened by the trail of police blunders, inefficiency and judicial rivalry that the Dutroux investigations have brought to light.</p>
<p>It has not been helped by the arrest of a chief detective in connection with related investigations into a car theft ring allegedly also operated by Dutroux and his accomplices. There have been suggestions of, at best, passive police protection.</p>
<p>In the light of all these discoveries, commentators have begun speculating whether the Belgian public will be as forgiving of its politicians in the future as it has been in the past.</p>
