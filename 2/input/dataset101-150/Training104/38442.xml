<p>Belgium prepared to bury two young girl victims of the child kidnapping, sex abuse, killing and car theft scandal as police began digging on Friday for bodies at the house of the chief suspect's mother in law.</p>
<p>Teenagers Eefje Lambrecks and her friend An Marchal, unearthed by police on Tuesday, will be buried on Saturday after separate church services in their home town of Hasselt, eastern Belgium. Both services will be televised live.</p>
<p>On Friday national flags hung at half mast in Hasselt and white flags draped many buildings as people queued quietly outside the Town Hall to sign condolence registers.</p>
<p>The decomposed bodies of the girls were found under a shed in the grounds of a house in the Jumet suburb of the city of Charleroi where convicted child rapist Marc Dutroux, who admits kidnapping them in August 1995, was a regular visitor.</p>
<p>The house was formerly occupied by Frenchman Bernard Weinstein, an accomplice whom Dutroux admits killing and who he accuses of murdering the two.</p>
<p>Belgium has been in shock and mourning since August 15 when Laetitia Delhez, 14, and Sabine Dardenne, 12, were rescued from a do-it-yourself dungeon in another house owned by Dutroux in the Marcinelle suburb of Charleroi.</p>
<p>The bodies of eight-year-olds Julie Lefeune and Melissa Russo were found dead from starvation two days later in a house owned by Dutroux in Sars-La-Buisierre south west of the city.</p>
<p>They were buried in the city of Liege amid a national outpouring of grief on August 22 -- the anniversary of the abduction of An and Eefje.</p>
<p>After removing quantities of papers and clothing on Thursday from a house in the Brussels suburb of Ixelles that is home to another alleged child molester and where Dutroux visited, police moved their attention 20 kms south to Waterloo on Friday.</p>
<p>Sniffer dogs led police to a spot in the garden of the mother of Dutroux' second wife Michelle Martin after neighbours reported hearing digging at night there in the past.</p>
<p>Martin, who is charged with being an accomplice of Dutroux, stayed there early this year while her husband was in jail for car theft.</p>
<p>At least seven other Belgian girls have gone missing in recent years. Their files are all now pooled in the Neufchateau nerve centre of the international paedophile hunt.</p>
<p>So far 10 people have been arrested in connection with the joint sex abuse and car theft investigations.</p>
<p>Discovery of the child sex abuse web stunned the country, forced tougher rules on early release of sex offenders and prompted calls for a global war against the child sex trade.</p>
<p>The fact that Dutroux was released early from a 13-year sentence for child rape, and that he has fathered three children by his two wives, has bewildered adults and children alike.</p>
<p>There have been allegations of police bungling or worse.</p>
<p>On Friday Liegois barrister Julien Pierre was appointed by the court to defend Dutroux after two other lawyers refused.</p>
<p>Public Prosecutor Michel Bourlet and investigating magistrate Jean Connerotte now travel only in bullet-proof cars, and Dutroux and others wear flak jackets when they are moved.</p>
<p>The hunt for missing girls and cars is international. Investigators have visited Slovakia and the Czech Republic and contacted police in Austria, Germany and Poland.</p>
<p>Authorities in Bratislava suspect Dutroux of the murder of a Slovak woman and the planned kidnapping of at least one other.</p>
<p>Police have found trench-like cells in one of Dutroux's houses and seized hundreds of pornographic paedophile video tapes -- some featuring Dutroux himself -- plus magazines, children's clothing and a gun.</p>
