<p>Two Austrian men arrested on suspicion of sexually abusing young refugee children have been released pending further investigations, the prosecuting attorney's office said on Monday.</p>
<p>News that the two suspects had been freed provoked an outcry from social workers, who expressed concern for the children's safety. Some demanded the men be held in detention throughout the probe.</p>
<p>&quot;It doesn't seem to be sensible that the two alleged culprits are free again,&quot; said Josef Weidenholzer, head of the social organisation Volkshilfe in Linz, 200 km (120 miles) west of Vienna where the abuse was said to have taken place.</p>
<p>&quot;Someone must not have been thinking what consequences this could have,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>He said the children and their families were in shock, adding there were widespread fears the two alleged child abusers could now erase any possible traces of a crime.</p>
<p>The men had supposedly lured children as young as four from a refugee shelter in Linz to their homes by offering them between 500 and 5,000 schillings ($50 to $500) for sexual favours, sources close to the investigation said.</p>
<p>&quot;One of the men allegedly focused on little girls and the other only dealt with little boys,&quot; Weidenholzer said.</p>
<p>Police declined to confirm newspaper reports which said the two men lived in the same building which houses the refugee shelter.</p>
<p>The men, aged 62 and 37 respectively, were arrested on August 12 on suspicion of sexually abusing a series of refugee children aged between four and 15, a spokesman for the Linz regional court said.</p>
<p>&quot;The older one was released on August 14 due to lack of immediate evidence. The other was released on August 26 on the condition that he change his place of residence,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The prosecuting attorney's office in Linz said the older suspect had been set free unconditionally.</p>
<p>Police have completed their probe but the court is still investigating the case, a prosecutors' spokesman said. The suspects have not been officially charged and it was not known if or when a charge would be brought, he said.</p>
<p>Revelations of the child sex abuse scandal came less than a week after Vienna police detained three men on charges of sexually abusing minors and producing child pronography in a suspected network spread across central Europe.</p>
<p>The Austrian cases follow on the heels of a child abuse and murder case in Belgium, involving a suspected child pornogrpahy ring stretching as far as Austria's neighbour Slovakia. The Slovak capital of Bratislava is less than an hour's drive from Vienna.</p>
<p>Austrian police declined comment on any possible link between the Belgian case and the Austrian arrests.</p>
<p>But Weidenholzer, whose organisation is involved in refugee support work and has been investigating the abuse claims for an undisclosed period, said the case in Linz probably involved a larger ring of professional child abusers.</p>
<p>&quot;The sums of money involved are too large and our investigations have shown the contact between the children and their abusers was frequent,&quot; Weidenholzer said. &quot;There were certainly more people involved in this terrible tragedy.&quot;</p>
