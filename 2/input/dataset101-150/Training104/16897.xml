<p>Darkness and rain forced Belgian police to suspend excavations late on Tuesday at a house owned by suspected Belgian child sex gang leader Marc Dutroux and last occupied by an accomplice he admits to murdering.</p>
<p>Belgian media speculated about the possibility of five bodies at the site, including those of An Marchal and Eefje Lamrbecks who Dutroux says he kidnapped a year ago from the port of Ostend and who are still missing. The teenagers were aged 19 and 17 respectively at the time of their disappearance</p>
<p>Searches have extended so far to Slovakia and the Czech Republic.</p>
<p>&quot;For technical reasons and the possibility of destroying evidence, we have decided to stop digging...So far nothing has been found. We will start again at 9 a.m. (0700 GMT) tomorrow,&quot; Gendarmerie spokesman Jean-Marie Boudin told reporters.</p>
<p>Foreign experts assisted in the excavations on Tuesday after Dutroux, 39, a convicted multiple child rapist, was taken to the house in handcuffs and suggested sites to dig.</p>
<p>Boudin said police had excavated to a depth of two metres (6-1/2 feet) at one of four locations indicated by specially trained dogs inside the property, and six metres at one location in the garden.</p>
<p>Superintendent John Bennett, a British police officer who supervised excavations in the &quot;House of Horrors&quot; murder case in England two years ago which involved the use of sophisticated radar imaging equipment. He was brought in last week to help.</p>
<p>Reporters allowed briefly on to the scene saw several holes in the ground, covered with blue plastic to shield them from the rain, which hindered the work. The house was cordoned off.</p>
<p>The house was formerly inhabited by Dutroux' accomplice, Frenchman Bernard Weinstein, whom Dutroux has admitted killing.</p>
<p>Dutroux led police to the bodies of eight-year-olds Melissa Russo and Julie Lejeune and of Weinstein 10 days ago. They were buried in the garden of one of Dutroux' five other houses in and around the city of Charleroi.</p>
<p>Dutroux told police the two girls starved to death earlier this year, nine months after they were kidnapped in June 1995. He admits paying Weinstein and accomplice Michel Lelievre 40,000 Belgian francs ($1,300 at current rates) to kidnap them.</p>
<p>Two other girls, Laetitia Delhez, 14, and Sabine Dardenne, 12, were rescued on August 15 from a makeshift dungeon in another of Dutroux' houses. Dutroux has also admitted kidnapping teenagers An Marchal and Eefje Lambrecks a year ago. Police are still searching for them.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the national and international hunt for other missing Belgian children continues.</p>
<p>A Brussels police official told Reuters police were looking for at least three other Belgian girls who disappeared in the last five years. It was not known if Dutroux was involved.</p>
<p>Earlier on Tuesday Slovak police said they were cooperating with Belgian collegues in the search for An and Eefje.</p>
<p>They said Dutroux visited Slovakia a number of times and that about 10 young Slovak women went to Belgium at his invitation.</p>
<p>Separately, a court in Neufchateau on Tuesday confirmed the charges of criminal association against Michel Diakostavrianos and Claude Thirault, two men arrested in the Dutroux affair last week. In total 10 people have now been arrested in the case.</p>
