<p>A Belgian school is changing its name to honour two former pupils slain by a child-sex gang, media reports said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Crotteux Communal School in Grace-Hollogne near Liege is to be renamed the Julie and Melissa School, La Derniere Heure newspaper reported.</p>
<p>Eight-year-olds Julie Lejeune and Melissa Russo were found dead on August 17 on a property owned by convicted child rapist Marc Dutroux.</p>
<p>&quot;We wanted to pay homage to the two little girls,&quot; the newspaper quoted Mayor Maurice Mottard as saying.</p>
<p>Four young girls have died as captives of a paedophile porn ring alleged to have been run by Dutroux in a scandal that has shocked the nation and prompted calls for international action against vice trafficking in youngsters.</p>
<p>Two others were rescued from a cramped secret dungeon in a house owned by Dutroux, who was also involved in car theft.</p>
<p>Police, searching for at least seven other girls -- some missing for years -- on Tuesday made their 12th arrest in the case.</p>
<p>Dutroux, who has previously been charged only with abduction and illegal imprisonment, was also formally charged with the murder of Frenchman Bernard Weinstein -- an accomplice whom he admits killing.</p>
<p>Different police forces are currently engaged in a public slanging match with each other and the judicial authorities over who made the most mistakes in the bungled investigations.</p>
<p>Dutroux' own mother -- with whom he has not been on talking terms for more than 20 years -- denounced him to police as a criminal last year in an attempt to regain possession of her house from him. Police took no action.</p>
<p>Belgium has been in shock since the bodies of Julie and Melissa were found on a property owned by unemployed father of three Dutroux near the southern city of Charleroi. Weinstein's body was unearthed in the same spot.</p>
<p>The two children had been kidnapped by associates of Dutroux in June 1995. He said they starved to death early this year.</p>
<p>The discovery followed the rescue of two other girls -- Laetitia Delhez, 14, and Sabine Dardenne, 12, -- from the secret dungeon in another house owned by Dutroux in Marcinelle, a suburb of Charleroi.</p>
<p>Two more teenagers -- Eefje Lambrecks and An Marchal -- were found dead two and a half weeks later at the home of Weinstein.</p>
