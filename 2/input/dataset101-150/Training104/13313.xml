<p>Investigators arrested a senior police detective on Sunday in connection with their inquiries into Belgium's paedophile kidnap, killing and porn scandal, Public Prosecutor Michel Bourlet said.</p>
<p>&quot;Georges Zicot was arrested and will be charged with truck theft, insurance fraud and document forgery,&quot; Bourlet told a news conference.</p>
<p>He said Zicot's connection was through a murdered accomplice of convicted child rapist Marc Dutroux -- the central figure in the scandal that has sent shockwaves across Europe and triggered a hunt for an international child porn ring.</p>
<p>The prosecutor said there had been searches at three sites on Sunday, including one at the judicial police headquarters in the southern city of Charleroi where Zicot worked.</p>
<p>Zicot, 45, is a specialist in tackling vehicle theft. Belgian media reported that he had been questioned twice in the past two years about thefts but released both times. He was promoted to chief detective earlier this year.</p>
<p>Bourlet said two other people were also arrested. One was Gerard Pignon, the owner of a warehouse where stolen vehicles were allegedly stored. The other was insurer Thierry Dehaan.</p>
<p>Bourlet said the investigation into the vehicle theft ring would be added to the inquiry into the paedophile sex scandal in which five other people have already been arrested.</p>
<p>He said the connection was through Bernard Weinstein, an accomplice of Dutroux.</p>
<p>Weinstein was found dead last weekend alongside the bodies of eight-year-olds Julie Lejeune and Melissa Russo in a house near Charleroi belonging to Detroux, who said they starved to death, nine months after being abducted in June 1995.</p>
<p>Two other girls -- Laetitia Delhez and Sabine Dardenne -- were rescued from a dungeon in another of Dutroux' six houses 10 days ago, and police are hunting for at least two more -- An Marchal and Eefje Lambrecks -- who Dutroux has admitted kidnapping a year ago.</p>
<p>&quot;Dutroux has admitted killing Weinstein after a disagreement between the accomplices in an affair of truck theft,&quot; Bourlet told reporters.</p>
<p>Another four people were also questioned at the weekend but had not been detained, he added.</p>
<p>Anne Thily, public prosecutor in the eastern city of Liege where Julie and Melissa lived, told the news conference this was a major case involving some 50 investigators -- including two from the United States' Federal Bureau of Investigation.</p>
<p>Earlier on Sunday police with mechanical diggers and dogs trained to find bodies moved into a scrapyard owned by a German connected with Dutroux but left again some hours later apparently empty-handed.</p>
<p>Dutroux and associate Michel Lelievre have been charged with abduction and illegal imprisonment. Dutroux' second wife Michelle Martin has been charged as an accomplice. Three other people face charges of criminal association.</p>
<p>Recriminations have steadily built up over how Dutroux managed to prey on children unhindered for so long -- with allegations of protection in high places. Sunday's arrest will fuel that speculation.</p>
<p>Police documents leaked to the Belgian media catalogue a high degree of police bungling, incompetence and indifference.</p>
<p>Bourlet has said Dutroux featured on some of the more than 300 paedophile porn video tapes that have been seized. Police are also trying to trace the origin of soporific drugs seized from Dutroux' houses.</p>
<p>Prosecutor Thily said the fate of An and Eefje remained a mystery. But there has been speculation they were sold into prostitution in Slovakia or the Czech Republic where Dutroux was a frequent visitor. Belgian police have visited Bratislava and will visit Prague.</p>
