<p>Two teenage girls have been reported missing in Belgium after failing to return home from a shopping trip in the town of Liege, Belga news agency said early on Saturday.</p>
<p>The agency said the girls, Rachel Legeard, 18, and Severine Potty, 19, had boarded a bus home on Thursday afternoon but apparently got off before their stop. There has been no word of them since, it said.</p>
<p>Gendarmes in Liege posted the two as missing late on Friday and have set up a coordination centre to work on the case, Belga said.</p>
<p>Belgium has been shaken by the uncovering of a paedophile ring linked to a number of missing children, two of whom were found dead.</p>
