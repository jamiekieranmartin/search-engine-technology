<p>A child sex scandal which has shocked Belgium to the core took a new twist when investigators arrested a senior police detective in connection with the case.</p>
<p>The arrest added weight to widespread speculation that a paedophile gang, suspected of being led by convicted rapist Marc Dutroux, must have received high-placed protection.</p>
<p>The scandal, involving kidnapping, killing and paedophile pornography, had already sent waves of revulsion across Europe, triggered an international manhunt and prompted widespread recriminations.</p>
<p>Two kidnapped eight-year-old girls have been found dead, two other girls have been rescued and police are hunting at least two more girls who have been missing for a year.</p>
<p>Police have seized more than 300 paedophile video tapes -- some featuring Dutroux -- quantities of magazines, childrens' clothing and drugs used to pacify the young victims.</p>
<p>Dutroux, convicted in 1989 for multiple child rape, and associate Michel Lelievre have been charged with abduction and illegal imprisonment.</p>
<p>Michelle Martin, Dutroux' second wife, has been charged as an accomplice and three men are facing charges of criminal association.</p>
<p>But the arrest on Sunday of Chief Detective Georges Zicot, a specialist in tackling vehicle theft in the southern city of Charleroi, added a new dimension to the scandal.</p>
<p>&quot;Georges Zicot was arrested and will be charged with truck theft, insurance fraud and document forgery,&quot; Public Prosecutor Michel Bourlet told a news conference.</p>
<p>He said two other people were also arrested -- Gerard Pignon, owner of a warehouse where he alleged stolen vehicles were stored, and insurer Thierry Dehaan.</p>
<p>Bourlet said Zicot's connection was through Bernard Weinstein, an accomplice of Dutroux. &quot;Dutroux has admitted killing Weinstein after a disagreement between the accomplices in an affair of truck theft,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Weinstein was found dead last weekend with the bodies of eight-year-olds Julie Lejeune and Melissa Russo in a house near Charleroi belonging to Detroux, who said they starved to death nine months after being abducted in June 1995.</p>
<p>Two girls, Laetitia Delhez and Sabine Dardenne, were rescued from a dungeon in another of Dutroux' six houses 10 days ago and police are hunting for at least two more, An Marchal and Eefje Lambrecks, whom Dutroux has admitted kidnapping a year ago.</p>
<p>Bourlet said the investigation into the vehicle theft ring would be added to the inquiry into the paedophile sex scandal.</p>
<p>Anne Thily, public prosecutor in the eastern city of Liege where Julie and Melissa lived, told the news conference this was a major case involving some 50 investigators, including two from the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation.</p>
<p>Police in South Africa are cooperating with the FBI in investigations into a suspected child pornography trade spanning the United States, South Africa and Europe.</p>
<p>Recriminations have steadily built up over how Dutroux managed to remain at liberty for so long -- with allegations of protection in high places. Leaked police documents catalogue a high degree of police bungling, incompetence and indifference.</p>
<p>There is also widespread disbelief that no one appeared to question how Dutroux, an unemployed father of three with no visible means of support, managed to own so many houses.</p>
<p>Justice Minister Stefaan De Clerck has admitted that mistakes were made and ordered an inquiry.</p>
<p>Thily said the fate of An and Eefje remained a mystery. The media has speculated that they were sold into prostitution in Slovakia or the Czech Republic where Dutroux was a frequent visitor. Belgian police have been to Bratislava and will visit Prague.  REUTER</p>
