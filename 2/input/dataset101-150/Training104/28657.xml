<p>Belgian police found bones, probably human, on Tuesday while searching a property owned by convicted child rapist Marc Dutroux, the chief suspect in the country's child abduction, sex and death scandal, a police spokesman said.  </p>
<p>&quot;We discovered bones, probably of a human nature,&quot; Gendarmerie spokesman Major Jean-Marie Boudin told reporters.</p>
<p>Police have been digging in and around the house in the Charleroi suburb of Jumet for a week. The house is one of six owned by Dutroux.</p>
<p>Public Prosecutor Michel Bourlet, leading the hunt for a suspected paedophile sex gang and its victims, was at the site, as was the Charleroi police pathologist.</p>
<p>The bodies of two eight-year-old children were found alongside that of an adult accomplice of Dutroux on August 17 at a house owned by Dutroux in Sars-La-Buissiere south of Charleroi. No human remains had been found previously at the house in Jumet.</p>
