<p>Police with dogs and radar equipment will resume their body hunt in Belgium's child sex scandal on Friday, when three suspects including a senior police detective face formal charges in connection with the case.</p>
<p>Belgium has been in shock since chief suspect Marc Dutroux, a convicted multiple child rapist, led police on August 17 to the bodies of eight-year-olds Melissa Russo and Julie Lejeune in the garden of a house he owns at Sars-La-Buissiere.</p>
<p>Police have been digging for more bodies since Tuesday in Jumet, a suburb of the southern city of Charleroi, at one of Dutroux's other five houses in the area.</p>
<p>&quot;The dogs will be used in the basements to see if there are any bodies there,&quot; Gendarmerie spokesman Major Jean-Marie Boudin told reporters as searches ended on Thursday.</p>
<p>Excavations in the garden and a shed were interrupted by torrential rain. The Jumet investigation is expected to last at least another day. In all, 11 sites will be explored.</p>
<p>Belgian radio said police would travel to Bratislava and Prague to search for missing Belgian children.</p>
<p>Dutroux has been named in Bratislava as a suspect in the murder of a young Slovak woman. Interpol's Slovak office has said he was also believed to have planned the kidnapping of at least one other Slovak woman.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Belgian gendarmerie's special disappearances squad said they were likely to contact colleagues in Austria investigating what seemed to be a &quot;child-for-hire&quot; network spread across central Europe.</p>
<p>Three men were arrested there on suspicion of sexually abusing children.</p>
<p>Belgian police inspector Georges Zicot is expected to be formally charged for car theft, insurance fraud and forgery on Friday. Dutroux is also suspected to have been involved in a car theft ring.</p>
<p>The court is also expected to formally charge two others in connection with a car and truck theft ring.</p>
<p>Dutroux has been linked with several people arrested for the organised vehicle theft and police are investigating the child sex and theft ring jointly.</p>
<p>Zicot's lawyer told Belgian television his client, a specialist in tackling car theft, was innocent and had become the victim of rivalry between police forces -- reinforcing the allegations of police bungling and ineptitude made so far.</p>
<p>The Belgian government is due to formally adopt new measures on sex offenders at a cabinet meeting on Friday. These include tougher rules on early release from jail.</p>
<p>Dutroux was released 10 years early in 1992 after serving only three years of a 13-year sentence for raping five children.</p>
<p>Searches for bodies and clues have focused on teenagers An Marchal and Eefje Lambrecks, who Dutroux, 39, has admitted kidnapping a year ago. Their fate remains unknown.</p>
<p>Dutroux's accomplice Bernard Weinstein, who he admitted killing, was found next to Julie and Melissa. Two other girls, Laetitia Delhez, 14, and Sabine Dardenne, 12, were rescued on August 15 from a dungeon in another of Dutroux's houses.</p>
<p>Dutroux has said Julie and Melissa, who were abducted in June 1995, starved to death early this year.</p>
<p>In their investigations police have so far seized up to 400 videos -- some featuring Dutroux -- children's clothing, magazines and a gun.</p>
<p>The affair has grabbed world headlines and prompted wider debate on trade in children, prostitution, paedophilia, and the role of the Internet computer network in spreading the sickness.</p>
<p>Belgian media reported on Thursday an unemployed man had been arrested in Flanders for trying to sell 3,000 pornographic photographs via the Internet -- one third were of children.</p>
<p>Ten people have so far been arrested including Dutroux's second wife Michelle Martin, who has been charged as an accomplice. Dutroux, a father of three, and associate Michel Lelievre are charged with abduction and illegal imprisonment.</p>
