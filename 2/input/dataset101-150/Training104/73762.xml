<p>European Union justice ministers gather on Thursday to discuss ways of stamping out cross-border child sex &quot;trafficking&quot; following revelations of child murder, prostitution and pornography in Belgium.</p>
<p>Irish Prime Minister John Bruton, who will host the conference in Dublin, said Ireland would urge ministers to extend the mandate of the EU's embryonic police agency Europol, based in the Dutch capital The Hague, so that it can deal with the child sex trade.  </p>
<p>EU Justice Commissioner Anita Gradin told Reuters she would urge EU governments to urgently ratify the convention which will put Europol fully to work.</p>
<p>&quot;Everyone should go home and ratify the Europol convention. If we want to get hold of these gangs who are...abducting children then you need a Europol that's effective,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Bruton said there was an urgent need to act.</p>
<p>&quot;Recent events brought home to us all the obscene and shocking crimes perpetrated against children on our continent,&quot; Bruton, whose country is current EU president, recently told the European Parliament.  </p>
<p>The world reacted with horror when the bodies of two young Belgian girls, kidnapped from their Liege homes in June 1995, were found in August in a property owned by a convicted rapist in south Belgium. They had been starved to death.</p>
<p>The bodies of two other young women, abducted in August 1995 from the Belgian seaside town of Ostend, were found on another property associated with the man three weeks ago.</p>
<p>Two other girls were rescued, and the ensuing investigation revealed links between the Belgian ring and the Czech Republic and Slovakia and links with trafficking in stolen cars.  </p>
<p>Official believe the fate of the four girls exposes a deeper problem of international &quot;trafficking&quot; in kidnapped children.</p>
<p>EU members, jealous of their own police and judicial systems, have previously been reluctant to extend the EU's competence to lead the fight against cross-border crime, which also involves drugs, cars and nuclear materials and money laundering.</p>
<p>But EU officials hope that the EU will be so shaken that national governments will now put aside their reservations.</p>
<p>Until the Europol convention, previously delayed by a row between Britain and its EU partners over the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, is ratified Europol cannot start vital work analysing data provided by various police forces.</p>
<p>Gradin said she would also urge the increased practice in member states of trying at home the many Europeans who go overseas as &quot;sex tourists&quot; to indulge in sex with children.</p>
<p>Belgium has said it will push for a Europe-wide solution to combat use by paedophile and pornography networks to advertise their wares on the internet, which is little policed and where anonymity can be assured.</p>
