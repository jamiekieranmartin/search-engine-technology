<p>Police investigating a Belgian child kidnapping, porn and killing scandal that has stunned Europe prepared to dig for a third day on Thursday at one of six houses owned by chief suspect Marc Dutroux.</p>
<p>&quot;Our first mission is looking for bodies. We don't know how many there could be,&quot; Gendarmerie Commander Johan Dewinne said on Wednesday after police spent a fruitless day excavating at the site in Jumet, near Charleroi in southern Belgium.</p>
<p>&quot;Jumet still has not delivered up its secrets,&quot; popular daily Vers L'Avenir said in its front page headline. &quot;The macabre searches at Jumet will continue to the finish,&quot; Francophone paper Le Soir declared.</p>
<p>Dewinne has said he hopes to wrap up excavations there by late Friday. In all 11 sites will be searched in coming days.</p>
<p>Searches for bodies and clues have focused on teenagers An Marchal and Eefje Lambrecks, whom Dutroux, 39, has admitted kidnapping a year ago. Their fate remains unknown although police have expressed some hope they are still alive.</p>
<p>The nation went into shock on August 17 as Dutroux led police to the bodies of eight-year-old friends Melissa Russo and Julie Lejeune in the garden of another house he owns. Dutroux's accomplice Bernard Weinstein, whom he admitted killing, was buried nearby.</p>
<p>Two other girls, Laetitia Delhez, 14, and Sabine Dardenne, 12, were rescued on August 15 from a makeshift dungeon in another of the houses Dutroux owns.</p>
<p>Described as cold and manipulative, Dutroux was released 10 years early in 1992 for good behaviour from a 13-year sentence for multiple child rape, violence and illegal imprisonment.</p>
<p>Dutroux, a father of three, and an associate Michel Lelievre have been charged with abduction and illegal imprisonment.</p>
<p>The lawyer who defended Dutroux in 1989 on the rape charges has refused to do so again on moral grounds.</p>
<p>Britain's Superintendent John Bennett who supervised excavations in the Fred and Rosemary West serial murder case in England two years ago, was present at Jumet on Wednesday.</p>
<p>There were also fresh searches at other sites including the house in Sars-La-Buissiere where Melissa and Julie were hidden.</p>
<p>Dutroux said the girls, who disappeared in June 1995, starved to death early this year, He denies killing them but admits paying accomplices 40,000 francs ($1,300) to kidnap them.</p>
<p>They were buried in the city of Liege a week ago after what amounted to a state funeral amid outpourings of grief and anger.</p>
<p>As the searches continued in Belgium, Dutroux was named in Bratislava as a suspect in the murder of a young Slovak woman. The Slovak office of Interpol said he was also believed to have planned the kidnapping of at least one other Slovak woman.</p>
<p>So far 10 people have been arrested in what has now become known as the &quot;Dutroux Affair&quot;, including Dutroux' second wife Michelle Martin, who has been charged as an accomplice.</p>
<p>Martin and Lelievre were interrogated again on Wednesday.</p>
<p>There has been widespread anger over revelations of police bungling, and the Justice Ministry has ordered an inquiry. A chief police detective has also been arrested on fraud charges, fuelling questions about a possible high-level cover-up.</p>
<p>There is also widespread disbelief that no one appeared to question how Dutroux, an unemployed father of three with no visible means of support, managed to own six houses.</p>
