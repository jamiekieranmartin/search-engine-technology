<p>Belgian police on Wednesday suspended their search for bodies at a house owned by the chief suspect in the scandal of child kidnapping, porn and killing that has stunned Europe.</p>
<p>Gendarmerie spokesman Major Jean-Marie Boudin said digging would resume on Thursday.</p>
<p>As the scandal continued to reverberate around the country, the lawyer of convicted child rapist Marc Dutroux, the man at the centre of the storm, has refused to defend him.</p>
<p>Belgium was plunged into shock 11 days ago after Dutroux led police to the bodies of eight-year-old friends Melissa Russo and Julie Lejeune in his garden. Buried with them was an accomplice Bernard Weinstein, whom he admitted killing.</p>
<p>&quot;I have a little girl of Julie and Melissa's age, who has been really disturbed by these events, and I don't think she could have understood that her father was defending this man,&quot; lawyer Didier de Quevy told Belgian radio.</p>
<p>Dutroux and associate Michel Lelievre have been charged with abduction and illegal imprisonment.</p>
<p>Two other girls, Laetitia Delhez, 14, and Sabine Dardenne, 12, were rescued on August 15 from a makeshift dungeon in another of the six houses Dutroux owns in and around the southern city of Charleroi.</p>
<p>Dutroux has also confessed to kidnapping teenagers An Marchal and Eefje Lambrechts who disappeared from the port of Ostend a year ago. Their fate remains unknown.</p>
<p>While hope flickers that An and Eefje may still be alive, speculation has grown in the Belgian media that five bodies might be hidden at the site in Jumet, near Charleroi. The house has been the scene of intense police activity since Tuesday.</p>
<p>Battling against heavy rain, investigators used an excavator in the yard -- which had been cleared of debris -- and were completing digging beneath a concrete floor in a shed at four spots located on Tuesday by sniffer dogs.</p>
<p>&quot;We're looking for all possible indications, but of course primarily bodies,&quot; Boudin told reporters earlier.</p>
<p>Boudin said the basement of the house was also being cleared out to allow sniffer dogs to search there, but reporters allowed a brief tour of the garden said the basement remained full of rubble and rubbish.</p>
<p>Britain's Superintendent John Bennett who supervised excavations in the Fred and Rosemary West &quot;House of Horrors&quot; murder case in England two years ago, was present on Wednesday.</p>
<p>There were also reports of fresh searches at other sites including Dutroux' house in Sars-La-Buissiere where Melissa and Julies' bodies were hidden.</p>
<p>Dutroux said the girls, who disappeared in June 1995, starved to death early this year, He denies killing them but admits paying accomplices 40,000 francs ($1,300) to kidnap them.</p>
<p>As the searches continued in Belgium, Dutroux was named in Bratislava as a suspect in the murder of a young Slovak woman. The Slovak office of Interpol said he was also believed to have planned the kidnapping of at least one Slovak woman.</p>
<p>So far 10 people have been arrested in what has now become known as the &quot;Dutroux Affair&quot;, including Doutroux' second wife Michelle Martin who has been charged as an accomplice.</p>
<p>Martin and Lelievre were both interrogated again on Wednesday.</p>
<p>There has been widespread anger over revelations of police bungling, and the Justice Ministry has ordered an inquiry. A chief police detective has also been arrested on fraud charges, fuelling questions about a possible high-level cover-up.</p>
<p>At least 15 children have gone missing in Belgium in the past six years. To date seven have been found dead, two have been rescued and six are still officially listed as missing.</p>
