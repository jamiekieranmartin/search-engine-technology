<p>Can a father take a bath with his five-year old son or daughter? Is it OK to hug your 10-year old nephew? And what if the neighbours' 12-year old daughter kisses you on the cheek when she meets you on the street?</p>
<p>One of the consequences of the paedophile kidnap, sex and murder scandal which has rocked Belgium in the past month is that adults, especially males, have become much more nervous about physical displays of affection towards children.</p>
<p>&quot;My husband used to go take a bath with our (four-year old) daughter. But this affair has made me think. What if she talks about it in school?&quot; said Mieke, a 36-year old Belgian lobbyist.</p>
<p>&quot;At my son's birthday party, one of the boys came over, gave me a hug, said 'you are my mummy' and put his head in my lap -- while other parents were there. I was petrified. Because of the Dutroux affair,&quot; said Victor, father of a five-year-old.</p>
<p>The gruesome details of how a paedophile gang, in which Marc Dutroux is the chief suspect, kidnapped, abused and killed four girls have been headline news nearly every day since mid-August.</p>
<p>Besides killing what faith Belgians had left in the ability of their police and courts to prevent such crimes, it has brought home the idea that atrocities like this can happen here.</p>
<p>Despite the scandal surrounding the Dutroux case and recent discoveries in the 1991 murder of politician Andre Cools, Belgium is still a low-crime country, where drug warfare, gang violence and sex crimes make headlines because they are rare.</p>
<p>&quot;This is terrible, it is the loss of innocence for a whole country. In my country (the U.S.) this happened a long time ago,&quot; said Nathan, 34, a New York TV producer visiting Belgium.</p>
<p>He quoted from &quot;Disclosure&quot;, Michael Crichton's best-selling novel about sexual harrassment of men, to illustrate how American males feel about intimacy with children:</p>
<p>&quot;Don't smile at a child on the street, unless you're with your wife. Don't ever touch a strange child. Don't ever be alone with someone else's child, even for a moment...At a party, don't let a little girl sit on your lap. If she tries, gently push her aside. If you ever have occasion to see a naked child, look quickly away. Better yet, leave.&quot;</p>
<p>One long-time resident of the United States, now working in Belgium, said that while it was easy to overstate the concern in America, he had been aware of possible pitfalls as a soccer coach for eight year olds.</p>
<p>&quot;You had to be aware that hugs and other ways of celebrating could be misinterpreted,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>In Belgium, most men would be less apprehensive about this.</p>
<p>&quot;When my (five-year old) son's friends come to me in the playground and want to wrestle, I wrestle with them, it is the most normal thing in the world,&quot; said a Brussels architect, 34.</p>
<p>&quot;Children are very physical. And taking a bath with your child is the most natural thing in the world,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>An article entitled &quot;The Eros of Parenthood&quot; in the U.S. magazine the New Yorker last February described how not touching children could also be a crime.</p>
<p>&quot;What else can we make of research that tells us paedophiles tend to subscribe to...puritanical views about sex? That, within a family, harshly conservative values are a risk factor for sexual abuse. Or that sexual abuse is more likely to occur in families where there is an absence of physical affection?&quot;</p>
<p>Luk Goethals, 42, a bookkeeper in Ghent, agrees.</p>
<p>He said the Dutroux case had not changed his behaviour towards children but there was a risk that the media attention about would stifle men's natural reactions to children.</p>
<p>&quot;I hope we will be able to continue experiencing intimacy with our own children and those of our friends,&quot; he said.</p>
