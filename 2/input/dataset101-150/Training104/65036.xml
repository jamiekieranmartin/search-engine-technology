<p>Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene said on Thursday serious errors in the investigation of the paedophile sex, kidnap and murder cases would be punished.</p>
<p>&quot;If it appears that during earlier phases of the investigation serious errors have been made, they will be sanctioned,&quot; Dehaene said in a speech to parliament which convened early to discuss the twin paedophilia and political murder scandals which have rocked the country.</p>
<p>&quot;The justice minister has ordered an inquiry into the investigation of the child kidnappings. He has just received the report and will inform parliament about it,&quot; Dehaene said.</p>
<p>He said the conclusion would be presented to the parliament's justice commission as soon as possible.</p>
<p>He gave no information about the contents of the report.</p>
<p>Belgian media said on Thursday the report was highly critical of police cooperation and procedures.</p>
<p>Dehaene also said that the judiciary should do its utmost to make progress in the investigation into the 1991 mafia-style murder of leading socialist politician Andre Cools.</p>
<p>&quot;The investigation into the murder raised many questions and led to a general feeling of mistrust of our institutions. The judiciary now must go to the heart of the matter,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Speakers of all parties will take the floor at 2 p.m. (1200 GMT) in this extraordinary session which was convened at the request of the opposition, two weeks before the parliamentary year had been due to start.</p>
<p>Parties were expected to back the setting-up of a committee of inquiry into judicial bungling in the investigations of the Cools murder and the activities of the paedophile ring which has claimed the lives of four young girls in the past year.</p>
<p>In both cases there have been allegations of cover-ups.</p>
<p>There have been indications of serious police bungling in the child sex affair and of possible high-level protection of the main suspect in the case, convicted child rapist Marc Dutroux.</p>
<p>The investigation into Cools's murder led to the discovery of high-level corruption in an army helicopters contract in the late eighties, which triggered the resignation of four Belgian government ministers and of former Belgian Nato Secretary-General Willy Claes.</p>
<p>&quot;Together we must ask ourselves what has gone wrong. We must also wonder what we have done wrong ourselves, each of us, in politics, in the judiciary, the police, in the media, and the population in general so as to prevent a repeat of these events,&quot; Dehaene said.</p>
