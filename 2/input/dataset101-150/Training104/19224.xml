<p>National Police Chief Gen. Rosso Jose Serrano on Wednesday called for the death penalty for kidnappers in Colombia, which has one of the highest abduction rates in the world.</p>
<p>&quot;We should revive proposals aimed at establishing the death penalty for kidnappers,&quot; he told a meeting sponsored by the private Fundacion Pais Libre (Free Country Foundation), which offers counselling to kidnap victims and their families.</p>
<p>Capital punishment does not exist in Colombia, but Serrano said it was needed for kidnappers because leaders of criminal organisations continue to order abductions from their jail cells. Calls for the death penalty have been made by Serrano and President Ernesto Samper in the past, but Congress has shown little or no interest in the issue.</p>
<p>Pais Libre is headed by Francisco Santos, a prominent newspaperman kidnapped by gunmen in the pay of notorious Medellin cartel drug lord Pablo Escobar in 1990. He told the meeting 641 people were kidnapped in Colombia between January and July, down slightly from the 665 cases reported during the same period last year.</p>
<p>Of the total number of victims, 193 have been freed so far, 117 were rescued and 35 were killed by their captors, Santos said. Between January 1995 and July 1996, kidnap victims have included 74 foreigners, he added, saying &quot;the trend is toward an increase in the kidnapping of foreigners.&quot;</p>
<p>Leftist guerrillas and common criminals reponsible for most of Colombia's kidnappings were expected to earn more than $127 million in ransoms this year alone, Santos said.</p>
