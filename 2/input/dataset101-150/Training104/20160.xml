<p>Belgian police have so far arrested 10 people -- nine men and one woman -- in a scandal of child sex, kidnapping and killing that has shocked Europe. They are:</p>
<p>Marc Dutroux, 39, is alleged to be the dominant person in a paedophile pornography ring as well as dabbling in car theft. He served three years of a 13-year sentence for child rape and was released for good behaviour in 1992. He was jailed from December 1995 to April 1996 for involvement in car theft. Twice married, he has three children and owns six houses in and around the city of Charleroi although his only declared income is a small disability pension. He features in some of more than 300 paedophile video tapes seized by police. He has admitted kidnapping at least four girls and killing accomplice Bernard Weinstein. He has been charged with abduction and illegal imprisonment of children. His own lawyer refuses to defend him.</p>
<p>Michel Lelievre, an alleged accomplice of Dutroux in both child pornography and car theft, lived in a Dutroux house in the Charleroi suburb of Marchienne-au-Pont where police found trench-like cells in the cellar with evidence of occupation by children. Dutroux has told police he paid Lelievre and Weinstein 40,000 francs ($1,300) for kidnapping eight-year-olds Julie Lejeune and Melissa Russo in June 1995 and says Weinstein and Lelievre let them starve to death this year while he was in prison. Lelievre has been charged with abduction and illegal imprisonment.</p>
<p>Michelle Martin, a former schoolteacher, is the second wife of Dutroux and mother of two of his children. She was sentenced to three years in jail in 1989 for acting as his accomplice in illegally imprisoning children. She has been charged as an accomplice in abductions and imprisonment.</p>
<p>Jean-Michel Nihoul, a Brussels-based businessman, admits knowing Dutroux, whom he says repaired a car for him, and Lelievre. He has been charged with criminal association.</p>
<p>Michael Diakostavrianos, of Greek origin, lives in a house owned by Dutroux in the Charleroi suburb of Mont-sur-Marchienne where police discovered quantities of video tapes and magazines. Neighbours said he travelled frequently. He has been charged with criminal association.</p>
<p>Claude Thirault, an acquaintance of Dutroux, has been charged with criminal association.</p>
<p>Georges Zicot, chief detective in the Charleroi judicial police and a specialist in tackling car theft, was questioned twice in the past two years about car thefts and released both times. He has been linked to Dutroux through Weinstein. He has been charged with vehicle theft, insurance fraud and forgery.</p>
<p>Gerard Pinon, busniessman and owner of a warehouse in Charleroi, was an acquaintance of Dutroux. He faces charges of receiving stolen goods, particularly vehicles, and criminal association.</p>
<p>Thierry Dehaan, an insurance company representative in Charleroi and acquaintance of Dutroux, faces charges of fraud relating to car theft.</p>
<p>Pierre Rochow, son of a German scrap metal merchant with a business in Charleroi, faces charges of car theft and receiving stolen goods.</p>
