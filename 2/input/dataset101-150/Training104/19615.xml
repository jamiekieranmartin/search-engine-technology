<p>Police investigating Belgium's scandal of child kidnapping, porn and killing scandal that has revolted Europe dig again on Thursday at one of the six houses owned by the man at the centre of the inquiry Marc Dutroux.</p>
<p>Although the search has focused on two teenagers -- An Marchal and Eefje Lambrecks -- who Dutroux has admitted kidnapping a year ago, police have files on 13 children who have gone missing over the past 10 years.</p>
<p>&quot;We are working on 13 dossiers on missing children from the past 10 years,&quot; Gendarmerie Commander Johan Dewinne told reporters late on Wednesday after police spent a fruitless day digging at one of the houses owned by Dutroux in and around the southern city of Charleroi.</p>
<p>The nation went into shock on August 17 as Dutroux led police to the bodies of eight-year-old friends Melissa Russo and Julie Lejeune in the garden of another house he owns. With them lay accomplice Bernard Weinstein, whom he admitted killing.</p>
<p>Dutroux, 39 and described as cold and manipulative, was released 10 years early in 1992 for good behaviour from a 13-year sentence for multiple child rape, violence and illegal imprisonment.</p>
<p>Dewinne, head of the Belgian disaster investigation squad and leading the hunt for corpses and clues, said he hoped to wrap up excavations at the house in Jumet, a suburb of Charleroi, by Friday evening.</p>
<p>He said a total of 11 sites would be searched in coming days.</p>
<p>As the scandal echoed around the country, the lawyer who defended Dutroux in 1989 on the rape charges refused to defend him again on moral grounds.</p>
<p>Dutroux, a father of three, and associate Michel Lelievre have been charged with abduction and illegal imprisonment.</p>
<p>Two other girls, Laetitia Delhez, 14, and Sabine Dardenne, 12, were rescued on August 15 from a makeshift dungeon in another of the houses Dutroux owns.</p>
<p>The fate of An Marchal and Eefje Lambrechts remains unknown, although since the Dutroux arrest police have continually put a hopeful slant on their declarations about the fate of the pair.</p>
<p>Britain's Superintendent John Bennett who supervised excavations in the Fred and Rosemary West serial murder case in England two years ago, was present on Wednesday.</p>
<p>There were also fresh searches at other sites including the house in Sars-La-Buissiere where Melissa and Julie were hidden.</p>
<p>Dutroux said the girls, who disappeared in June 1995, starved to death early this year, He denies killing them but admits paying accomplices 40,000 francs ($1,300) to kidnap them.</p>
<p>They were buried in the eastern city of Liege on Thursday after what amounted to a state funeral amid outpourings of grief and anger.</p>
<p>As the searches continued in Belgium, Dutroux was named in Bratislava as a suspect in the murder of a young Slovak woman. The Slovak office of Interpol said he was also believed to have planned the kidnapping of at least one other Slovak woman.</p>
<p>So far 10 people have been arrested in what has now become known as the &quot;Dutroux Affair&quot;, including Dutroux' second wife Michelle Martin who has been charged as an accomplice.</p>
<p>Martin and Lelievre were interrogated again on Wednesday.</p>
<p>There has been widespread anger over revelations of police bungling, and the Justice Ministry has ordered an inquiry. A chief police detective has also been arrested on fraud charges, fuelling questions about a possible high-level cover-up.</p>
<p>There is also widespread disbelief that no one appeared to question how Dutroux, an unemployed father of three with no visible means of support, managed to own six houses.</p>
