<p>Belgian police said on Saturday they had found no trace of two teenage girls reported missing during a shopping trip three days ago.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no trace so far, the enquiry is continuing,&quot; a Liege police official told Reuters.</p>
<p>Late on Friday, Liege police said in a statement that on Thursday, Rachel Legeard, 18, and Severine Potty, 19, had gone shopping to the eastern town of Liege on Thursday, where Legeard's wallet had been stolen.</p>
<p>After reporting the theft to the police, they took a bus home and reportedly got off the bus before arriving in their home village of Nandrin. They have not been seen since.</p>
<p>Police declined to comment on whether it suspected a link with the Marc Dutroux case, the paedophile kidnap, sex abuse and murder scandal which has rocked Belgium in the past two weeks.</p>
