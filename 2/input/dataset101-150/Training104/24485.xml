<p>The Belgian cabinet approved tougher rules on Friday on the early release from jail of convicted paedophiles after revelations of a child sex, porn and murder scandal.</p>
<p>Chief suspect in the affair Marc Dutroux was released from jail on parole 10 years early in 1992 from a 13-year sentence for multiple child rape. Two weeks ago he was charged with abduction and illegal imprisonment of children.</p>
<p>&quot;The government has approved certain new measures,&quot; Justice Minister Stefaan De Clerck told reporters.</p>
<p>These included setting up a special tribunal of magistrates to vet requests for early release, which would work on the basis of unanimity for paedophiles and in other serious cases.</p>
<p>Up to now the decision on early release has been left to the justice minister based on a majority of opinions from people ranging from the original prosecutor in the case to social workers, psychiatrists and prison staff.</p>
<p>Former Justice Minister Melchior Wathelet bore the brunt of public anger when the scandal erupted. He had signed Dutroux's release papers after a narrow majority of the opinions he received were favourable.</p>
<p>&quot;The justice minister will no longer be involved in deciding conditional release,&quot; De Clerck told a news conference after the first cabinet meeting since the affair broke.</p>
<p>Victims of sexual abuse would receive more help, abusers would be treated in special centres and be more closely monitored on their release and there would be better international coordination between police forces, he said.</p>
<p>There would also be an independent examination of all the 8,000 examples of prisoners currently on conditional release to see how well they were being followed. They would start with the most risky cases, which included sex offenders.</p>
<p>Belgium would also propose to other European Union member states that there be more international cooperation, for example in the fight against trafficking in people for prostitution and in finding ways to control the distribution of pornography.</p>
<p>&quot;The international aspect of crime and criminal networks demands a more adequate approach at the heart of the international forum,&quot; De Clerck said.</p>
<p>In two weeks of searching police have so far discovered the bodies of eight-year-olds Julie Lejeune and Melissa Russo in the garden of one of the six houses Dutroux, 39, owns in and around the southern city of Charleroi.</p>
<p>They have rescued two other sexually abused girls -- Laetitia Delhez, 14, and Sabine Dardenne, 12, -- from a dungeon in another of his houses and are searching for at least two others whom Dutroux admits kidnapping.</p>
