<p>Police searching a property owned by Marc Dutroux, chief suspect in Belgium's child sex abuse and murder scandal, on Tuesday found the decomposing bodies of two adolescents or adults, a medical source said.</p>
<p>&quot;They have found two bodies in an advanced state of decomposition,&quot; the source told Reuters on condition of anonymity.</p>
<p>There was no immediate official comment, but Belga news agency cited a judicial source as saying the remains of at least two people had been found.</p>
<p>Police earlier said they had found what appeared to be human remains without giving any further details.</p>
<p>&quot;We discovered bones, probably of a human nature,&quot; Gendarmerie spokesman Major Jean-Marie Boudin told reporters outside the house in the Charleroi suburb of Jumet, formerly occupied by Dutroux associate Bernard Weinstein.</p>
<p>Dutroux has said he murdered Weinstein and also admitted kidnapping An Marchal, 17, and Eefje Lambrecks, 19, a year ago. The fate of the two girls remains a mystery.</p>
<p>Several other Belgian girls have gone missing in recent years. Their files are all now pooled in Neufchateau, nerve centre of an international paedophile hunt.</p>
<p>An eight-year-old Zairean girl who went missing in Liege on Monday was found safe on Tuesday. She had run away.</p>
<p>Boudin urged reporters not to speculate about the identity of the remains, saying: &quot;We don't know&quot;.</p>
<p>Police have been digging around the Jumet house, one of six owned by Dutroux in or near Charleroi, for the past week. The bones were found underneath a shed in the garden.</p>
<p>Public Prosecutor Michel Bourlet, leading the hunt for a paedophile sex gang and its victims, visited the site, as did police pathologist Jean-Pol Beauthiez.</p>
<p>Boudin said searches were suspended from the moment the bones were found. He said they would resume later in the afternoon.</p>
<p>The find follows discovery of the bodies of two eight-year-old children and that of Weinstein on August 17 at a house owned by Dutroux in Sars-La-Buissiere, south of Charleroi.</p>
<p>Dutroux said the two girls, Julie Lejeune and Melissa Russo, starved to death earlier this year, some nine months after being abducted.</p>
<p>Two other girls, Laetitia Delhez and Sabine Dardenne, were rescued from another of Dutroux's houses 12 days ago. Both had been sexually abused.</p>
<p>No remains had been found previously at the house in Jumet.</p>
<p>The discovery of the paedophile web has horrified the country, prompted the government to tighten rules on early release of sex offenders and triggered calls for a global war against the child sex trade.</p>
<p>The fact that Dutroux was released early from a 13-year sentence for child rape, and that he has fathered three children by his two wives, has bewildered adults and children alike.</p>
<p>The hunt for missing girls has taken on international dimensions. Belgian police have visited Slovakia and the Czech Republic and have contacted colleagues in Austria and Germany.</p>
<p>Authorities in Bratislava suspect Dutroux of the murder of a Slovak woman and the planned kidnapping of at least one other.</p>
<p>Nine people are now under arrest in the Belgian affair, including Dutroux's second wife Michelle Martin.</p>
<p>Police have found trench-like cells allegedly for holding kidnapped children in one of Dutroux's houses and seized more than 300 paedophile porn video tapes -- some featuring Dutroux himself -- plus magazines, childrens clothing and a gun.</p>
