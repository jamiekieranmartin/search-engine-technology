<p>Police searching for the bodies of missing girls using British radar-imaging equipment have found two &quot;hot spots&quot; in the basement of a house owned by Marc Dutroux, the chief suspect in Belgium's paedophile scandal.</p>
<p>&quot;Now we are using only the British apparatus in the cellar of the Jumet house,&quot; Gendarmerie spokesman Major Jean-Marie Boudin told reporters. &quot;Up to now this apparatus has indicated two places of interest in the cellar.&quot;</p>
<p>British police superintendent John Bennett, the man who led the investigations that unmasked Britain's &quot;House of Horrors&quot; serial murders, has been called in by Belgian police to help their enquiry.</p>
<p>The British radar-imaging equipment is triggered by finding cavities underground. In the &quot;House of Horrors&quot; case it was set off by underground holes which were found to contain bodies.</p>
<p>Boudin said the two &quot;hot spots&quot; would not be excavated until Monday to give weary police time to rest after a gruelling search for bodies which has already lasted two weeks.</p>
<p>Sniffer dogs used to locate bodies went into the cellar of the house in the Jumet suburb of the southern city of Charleroi earlier on Friday. Boudin said they too would rest at the weekend.</p>
<p>The Jumet house was formerly occupied by Frenchman Bernard Weinstein, an accomplice who Dutroux admits murdering.</p>
<p>Police have been excavating around the house for four days, with attention focused on a large brick shed in the garden.</p>
<p>Boudin said this building would be completely demolished and the concrete floor removed and excavated to a depth of five metres (yards).</p>
<p>&quot;We don't want to leave anything to chance,&quot; he said, adding that work there would also be suspended over the weekend.</p>
<p>Boudin said investigators had found a &quot;hot spot&quot; at another house owned by Dutroux in the Marcinelle suburb of Charleroi.</p>
<p>So far police have discovered the bodies of eight-year-olds Julie Lejeune and Melissa Russo buried in the garden of another of Dutroux's houses in Sars-La Buissiere, south west of Charleroi.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago they rescued two other sexually abused girls -- Laetitia Delhez and Sabine Dardenne -- from a dungeon in the Marcinelle house and are actively searching for at least two others -- An Marchal and Eefje Lambrecks -- whom Dutroux admits kidnapping a year ago.</p>
