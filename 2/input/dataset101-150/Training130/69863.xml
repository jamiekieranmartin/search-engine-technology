<p>President Clinton is expected to announce plans for the U.S. Treasury to issue inflation-linked bonds during a campaign trip to Pittsburgh on Wednesday, administration officials said on Monday.</p>
<p>The officials, who asked not to be named, said that the announcement was expected to emphasize using the bonds to save for college tuition and for retirement.</p>
<p>They said Clinton was expected to make the announcement while on a one-day campaign trip to Pennsylvania because it fits in with his emphasis on education during this election year.</p>
<p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin announced on May 16 that the Treasury intended as a multi-year experiment to issue the securities, which provide protection against inflation.  </p>
<p>Such securities are designed to strengthen national savings by offering people an investment that guarantees a return in excess of inflation. The Treasury has said it also expects them to lower its financing costs.</p>
<p>In May, the Treasury said it planned to issue them in denominations as low as $1,000 to make them available to people saving for retirement and their children's education.</p>
<p>&quot;We think the kinds of investors who will be most interested in these securities will be individual Americans saving for their retirement or other long-term purposes, including their children's education,&quot; Rubin said in a prepared text of a speech that he delivered in May.</p>
<p>At the time, the Treasury said the return on the new securities would be linked to inflation in prices or wages and that they would carry maturities of 10 or 30 years.</p>
<p>It also said it was considering various structures for the securities, including a zero-coupon bond.</p>
<p>Last Thursday Rubin told reporters that the Treasury planned to announce the terms and details of the first issue of inflation-indexed bonds &quot;in the reasonably near future.&quot;</p>
<p>White House and Treasury spokespeople declined comment on the matter on Monday.</p>
