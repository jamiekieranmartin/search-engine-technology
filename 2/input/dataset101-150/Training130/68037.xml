<headline>UK Labour eyes statutory youth training.</headline>

<p>Britain's opposition Labour party on Friday proposed a statutory requirement on employers to train 16-18 year olds as part of a new goal of achieving universal education for that age bracket.</p>
<p>Economics spokesman Gordon Brown, speaking at a news conference, also proposed replacing post-16 child benefit with an educational allowance for those attending school and college.  </p>
<p>Brown set the goal for 100 percent of young people to have a certain educational qualification, defined as the equivalent of five GCSE Grade C passes, by the age of 18.</p>
<p>&quot;We will introduce a statutory requirement on employers to enable people aged 16 to 18 who do not meet this basic standard to train, and encourage a national debate about staying on,&quot; Brown said.</p>
<p>He said the proposed education allowance would still be paid to mothers but would be subject to the following conditions:</p>
<p>-- the student should register for an approved educational course  </p>
<p>-- the student should attend and participate in course studies and undertake careers advice.</p>
<p>Brown said Labour's reforms would root out abuse of child benefit and mistaken claiming of the allowance and would enable resources to be focussed on those who need it most.</p>
<p>&quot;Rather than the millionaire family...receiving child benefit they do not need, while half of all mothers do not receive it at all, our new school and college allowance will be focussed specifically on meeting the financial needs of the middle and lower income families,&quot; Brown said.</p>
