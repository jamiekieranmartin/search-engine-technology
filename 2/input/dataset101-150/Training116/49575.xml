<p>Archaeologists have found the remains of one of the first English settlers in North America while digging for a fort built by Captain John Smith in Jamestown, Virginia, in 1607.</p>
<p>The Virginia newspaper Daily Press quoted forensic anthropologist Doug Owsley of the Smithsonian Institute as saying the skeleton was of a white male in his early 20's.</p>
<p>&quot;It was a violent death,&quot; Owsley was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>He had a wound to his right leg caused by a musketball and also a defect in his right shoulder which could also be from a musketball, Owsley said.</p>
<p>He dated the death to the earliest period of the 1607 settlement, based on artifacts discovered around the grave.</p>
<p>The remains were believed to be of an important figure because he was buried in a coffin, which was rare in early settlements, Oswley said.</p>
<p>Jamestown was the first permanent English settlement in North America.</p>
<p>Archaeologists have been searching for two years for the remains of a wooden fort built by Captain John Smith, who earned lasting fame from his relationship with Indian maiden Pocahontas.</p>
