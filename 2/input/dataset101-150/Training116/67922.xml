<p>Archaeologists in Austria have discovered the skeletal remains of a Stone Age girl, believed to be over 1,200 years older than the 5,300-year-old &quot;iceman&quot; found in 1991, the Austrian news agency APA said on Friday.</p>
<p>The bones were found on a 6,500-year-old Stone Age settlement near the northwestern city of Linz, archaeologist Manfred Pertlwieser at the Francisco Carolinum museum in northern Austria was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>Judging from the good condition of her teeth, the girl was estimated to be between 12 and 13 when she died. He said the body was curled up in a tight ball when it was buried, &quot;just as children crouch when they are cold&quot;.</p>
<p>He said she had probably died of a fever or frozen to death. Remains of a fireplace near her grave suggest she was buried in her home.</p>
<p>The discovery comes after five years of excavation on the Stone Age settlement in Oelkam.</p>
<p>Previously the &quot;iceman&quot; discovered on a glacier in the Tyrolean Alps five years ago was the oldest human being to have been found intact.</p>
