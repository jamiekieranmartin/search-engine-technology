<p>Oil Search Ltd managing director Peter Botten said on Monday a full takeover offer for fellow oil producer Discovery Petroleum NL was an option available to the group following its purchase of a stake in Discovery.</p>
<p>&quot;That is only one of a number of options that that we have in order to maximise our investment in Discovery,&quot; managing director Peter Botten told Reuters.</p>
<p>He had been asked if Oil Search would make a bid. Oil Search last week bought a 10.1 percent stake in Discovery at around 75 cents share, above the hostile offer made by Premier Oil Plc.  </p>
<p>Botten said Oil Search would talk to Premier over the next couple of weeks about its investment in Discovery, but he added the company would wait for the formal Part B statement reply from Discovery to the Premier offer.</p>
<p>The Part B statement is expected mid-October.</p>
<p>However, Botten said the purchase of Discovery shares was not in reponse to the Premier bid.</p>
<p>&quot;Our investment in Discovery was not driven by the Premier offer, that was purely coincidental,&quot; Botten said.</p>
<p>&quot;We have been looking at Discovery for some time as we look to diversfy our risk profile and buy other production assets.&quot;  </p>
<p>Botten said Oil Search, which is based in Papua New Guinea (PNG), was not looking to diversify away from PNG where its main asset, an interest in the Kutubu oil field, is located.</p>
<p>&quot;The core of our business will always be in PNG, but as we grow into a bigger company, we are looking for opportunities to increase our cash flow and revenue from other production assets,&quot; Botten said.</p>
<p>He said that over the next 18 months Oil Search is planning to spend over A$200 million on exploration and development in PNG. Oil Search shares clsoed two cents higher at A$1.57, while Discovery shares were one cent up at 79 cents.</p>
