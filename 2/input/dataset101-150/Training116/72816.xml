<p>A tourist tunnel at the centre of a fresh Arab-Israeli dispute takes visitors on a journey through 2,500 years of Jerusalem history including the time of Jesus, Israel's Tourism Ministry said.</p>
<p>Israel triggered Palestinian protests when its workmen on Tuesday put in a second entrance to the tunnel which was opened several years ago beside Jerusalem's Temple Mount, site of Islam's third holiest shrine.</p>
<p>A ministry news release said visitors to the tunnel can explore a Hasmonean water system carved out in the Second Century B.C. and walk along a Herodian street -- possibly on the same stones where Jesus once walked.</p>
<p>The 488-metre (500-yard) tunnel is less than a metre-wide and spans almost the entire Wailing Wall abutting the ancient Jewish Temple Mount. It passes the wall's largest stone, which weighs 570 metric tonnes, and ends in the Struthion Pool documented by Josephus Flavius 1,900 years ago.</p>
<p>Until now only 70,000 people were able to visit each year as they were forced to enter and leave through the same opening. The ministry said the second opening and a restoration of the tunnel would enable 400,000 people to visit each year.</p>
<p>The tunnel passes through huge subterranean vaults built in the 14th century during the Mamluk period, a medieval cistern, and a gateway to the Temple Mount reconstructed by early Moslem inhabitants of Jerusalem and rediscovered by British archaeologist Charles Warren in 1867.</p>
<p>The tour includes a quarry from which the Wailing Wall's stones were excavated and other remnants of &quot;Underground Jerusalem,&quot; the title of a famous account by Warren.</p>
