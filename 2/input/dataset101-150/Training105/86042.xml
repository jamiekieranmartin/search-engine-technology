<p>The subcompact Geo Metro is the most fuel-efficient car of the 1997 model year, while Vector Aeromotive's exotic Avtech SC is the least, the Environmental Protection Agency said Monday.</p>
<p>In its annual mileage review, the agency rated General Motors Corp.'s subcompact Geo Metro, which was designed by Japan's Suzuki Motor Co., at 44 miles per gallon (mpg) in city driving and 49 mpg on the highway.</p>
<p>The Avtech SC was rated at nine miles per gallon in the city and 13 mpg on the highway.</p>
<p>Among the top 10 light-duty trucks, the Toyota two-wheel-drive RAV4 sport/utility vehicle with manual transmission had the best mileage, with 24 mpg in the city and 28 mpg on the highway.</p>
<p>The lowest-mileage light-duty truck was Chrysler's Dodge B3500 two-wheel drive wagon with a 5.9-litre V-8 engine. It got 11 mpg in the city and 15 mpg on the highway.</p>
<p>The Coalition for Vehicle Choice, which lobbies against increased federal fuel efficiency standards, said that the EPA report showed plenty of high-mileage vehicles were available but that consumers were not buying them.</p>
<p>&quot;The most recent sales data available -- MY (model year) '95 -- show EPA's top 10 most fuel-efficient cars represented less than one percent of passenger car sales and only a 0.6 percent of overall car and light truck sales,&quot; Diane Steed, president of the coalition, said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;MY '95 top 10 most fuel efficient light trucks represented less than four percent of the sale of pickups, vans, minivans and sport utility vehicles,&quot; Steed said.</p>
<p>Among the other high-mileage cars in the EPA's listing were the Volkswagen Golf/GTI, Jetta, Passat and Passat wagon, as well as another Geo Metro model.</p>
<p>Other high-mileage cars were the Suzuki Swift, two Honda Motor Co. Civics, and Ford Motor Co.'s Aspire.</p>
<p>Among the other lowest-mileage cars were the Lamborghini DB132/144 Diablo, three sports cars made by Ferrari, a unit of Fiat SpA, and five models built by Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, a unit of Vickers Plc.</p>
<p>Other high-mileage light trucks were four models of GM's Geo Tracker sport/utility vehicle, Isuzu Motors Ltd.'s Hombre pickup, GM's GMC Sonoma and  Chevrolet S10 pickups, and Toyota's Tacoma two-wheel-drive pickup.</p>
<p>Other low-mileage light trucks were two models of the Dodge B3500 two-wheel drive wagon, Bayerische Motoren Werke AG's Range Rover sport/utility, the Dodge Ram pickup, two models of GM's Suburban four-wheel drive sport/utility vehicle, Ford's E150 Club Wagon, Toyota's Lexus LX450 and Land Cruiser sport/utility vehicles, and Dodge's two-wheel drive B1500/B2500 Van.</p>
