<p>Nissan Motor Co Ltd said it will operate its Kyushu plant for an extra three days in September to raise production of its Regulus and Pathfinder models.</p>
<p>The production increase was decided because of good domestic demand for the Regulus, a newly launched sport-utility vehicle, and persistent strong demand in the United States for the Pathfinder sport-utility vehicle, called the Terrano in Japan, a Nissan spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>Nissan, Japan's second-biggest carmaker, received 1,072 domestic orders for the Regulus in the first 17 days after its launch on August 27 with a monthly target of 1,000.</p>
<p>Nissan exports some 6,000 Pathfinders per month to the United States due to strong demand, the spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>The Kyushu plant, in Fukuoka prefecture, produces the Pathfinder, Regulus, Pulsar (called the Almera in Europe) and Sunny models, and will also probably operate for an extra three days in October, the spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>Nissan aimed to raise its share of the domestic sport-utility vehicle market to a 27 percent in the year to March 1997 through sales of the new Regulus, up from 25 percent in the six months to March 1996.</p>
