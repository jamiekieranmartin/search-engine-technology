<p>Cable television has a useful role to play in serving local communities, a survey by Britain's Independent Television Commission (ITC) said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;Cable subscribers want local television: they are interested in their local community and want to find out about it on TV,&quot; watchdog the ITC said of the survey.</p>
<p>It added that 58 percent of respondents thought that access to local cable programmes and text services was one of the best features of cable television. The survey was based on interviews carried out late last year with some 500 cable subscribers.</p>
<p>The research showed that production quality was the most imporant factor in the success of a programme.</p>
<p>The ITC said that resources for local programming should be concentrated on producing a small amount of good quality programmes rather than a wide range of low quality material.</p>
<p>Local cable TV advertising, as with local radio ads, achieved high levels of awareness, the ITC said. It said quality appeared to be of less importance than repetition.</p>
