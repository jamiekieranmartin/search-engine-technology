<title>BELGIUM: EU ruling sets back Sweden ban on child adverts.</title>
<headline>EU ruling sets back Sweden ban on child adverts.</headline>

<p>A legal adviser at the European Court of Justice has told Sweden, which bans TV advertising aimed at children, that it cannot restrict commercials broadcast from another EU state.</p>
<p>Advocate-General Murray Jacobs issued an opinion on Tuesday saying the European Union's Television without Frontiers directive &quot;prevents a member state from taking action against television advertisements broadcast from another member state&quot;.</p>
<p>Opinions by the Advocates-General are only advisory, but are often followed by the court in later rulings.</p>
<p>A ruling against Sweden could prevent it from intervening against advertisements broadcast from other EU countries.</p>
<p>Europe's advertising industry sees the case as a critical test of its right to provide services across the EU.</p>
<p>Sweden is the only EU country that has a general ban on advertising aimed at children under 12.</p>
<p>However, Jacobs said EU law allowed Sweden to ban such commercials if both the advertiser and the broadcaster were based there and they were broadcast on a domestic TV channel received only by viewers in the country.</p>
<p>The Luxembourg-based court has been asked to decide whether EU law allows Sweden to bar advertisements aired by a TV channel based in a member state where they are legal.</p>
<p>The case involves an advertisement for a magazine about dinosaurs that publishing firm De Agostini Forlag AB aired on television channels TV3 and TV4 in 1993. TV3 is a British-based channel broadcasting to Sweden while TV4 is based in Sweden.</p>
<p>The Swedish Consumer Ombudsman, saying the advertisement should be banned, decided to take the firm to the Swedish Market Court, which asked for a preliminary ruling from the European Court.</p>
<p>The court battle is a sign of the realities of the new television age with authorities unable to control the contents of programmes broadcast from another country.</p>
<p>Reflecting this, Sweden wants the other 14 EU member states to agree to tighten up its rules on advertisements for children in the Television without Frontiers directive, so far without success.</p>
