<p>A legal adviser at the European Court of Justice has told Sweden, which bans TV advertising aimed at children, that it cannot restrict commercials broadcast from another European Union member state.</p>
<p>Advocate-General Murray Jacobs issued an opinion on Tuesday saying the EU's Television without Frontiers directive &quot;prevents a member state from taking action against television advertisements broadcast from another member state&quot;.</p>
<p>However, Jacobs said EU law allowed Sweden to ban such commercials if both the advertiser and the broadcaster were based there and they were broadcast on a domestic TV channel received only by viewers in the country.</p>
<p>Opinions by the Advocates-General are only advisory, but are often followed by the court in later rulings.</p>
<p>A ruling against Sweden could prevent it from intervening against advertisements broadcast from other EU countries.</p>
<p>Europe's advertising industry sees the case as a critical test of its right to provide services across the EU.</p>
<p>Swedish Consumer Ombudsman Axel Edling, fearing the Swedish ban may be undermined, reacted with disappointment.</p>
<p>&quot;Consumer protection in Sweden takes several steps backwards if this will also be the final judgement,&quot; Edling told the Swedish news agency TT in Stockholm.</p>
<p>Such a ruling may affect not only advertising aimed at children. &quot;It would also prevent us from intervening against misleading, unethical or inappropriate advertisement,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Sweden argues that children cannot always differ between advertisements and TV programmes.</p>
<p>It is the only EU country that has a general ban on advertising aimed at children under 12.</p>
<p>The Luxembourg-based court has been asked to decide whether EU law allows Sweden to bar advertisements aired by a TV channel based in a member state where they are legal.</p>
<p>The case involves an advertisement for a magazine about dinosaurs that publishing firm De Agostini Forlag AB aired on television channels TV3 and TV4 in 1993. TV3 is a British-based channel broadcasting to Sweden while TV4 is based in Sweden.</p>
<p>The Swedish Consumer Ombudsman, saying the advertisement should be banned, decided to take the firm to the Swedish Market Court, which asked for a preliminary ruling from the European Court.</p>
<p>The court battle is a sign of the realities of the new television age with authorities unable to control the contents of programmes broadcast from another country.</p>
