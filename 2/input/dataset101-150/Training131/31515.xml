<p>The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission said on Wednesday it awarded seven licenses for early launch of national specialty television services and 14 for later launch. It also awarded licenses for two regional services.</p>
<p>Among the winners for launch by September 1997 were two news channels. One, in English, will be owned by CTV Television Network Ltd, in which Baton Broadcasting Inc has a 42.9 percent voting stake. The second, in French, will be owned by Tele-Metropole Inc.</p>
<p>Firms controlled by CHUM Ltd won five licenses.  </p>
<p>A new venture, Report on Business television, won a license to present business news by September 1999. ROBTv is 50 percent owned by a company controlled by Kenneth Thomson -- owner of Thomson Canada Ltd, whose flagship newspaper is the Globe and Mail. ROBTv is 26-percent owned by WIC Western International Communications Ltd and 24 percent by Canadian Satellite Communications Inc.</p>
<p>The CRTC denied a license to a rival business news venture that would have been run by CHUM and the Toronto Sun Publishing Corp -controlled Financial Post.  </p>
<p>Four of the services that will use current technology and be available by next September will be in English and three will be in French. The other 16 -- including the two regional services -- will be in operation by September 1999 and will most likely use digital technology -- not yet available in Canada.</p>
<p>A Southam Inc news venture with the state-owned Canadian Broadcasting Corp failed to win a license.  </p>
<p>Shaw Communications Inc's YTV Canada Inc, which has the most successful specialty channel in Canada, won the rights to launch a second children's channel, called TreeHouse TV, by September 1999.</p>
<p>The CRTC also granted licenses to three sports ventures for operation by September 1999.</p>
<p>The first, to provide regional sports coverage, is 40-percent owned by CTV, 20 percent by the Molson Cos Ltd, 20 percent by Rogers Broadcasting Ltd and 20 percent by LMC International Inc.</p>
<p>The second channel, a pay-per-view service, is 60-percent owned by CTV and 20 percent each by Molson and LMC.</p>
<p>The third sports channel is controlled by the Clairvest Group Inc.</p>
