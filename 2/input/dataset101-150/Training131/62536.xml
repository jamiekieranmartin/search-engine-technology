<title>BELGIUM: Toy makers happy about EU view on Swedish ad ban.</title>
<headline>Toy makers happy about EU view on Swedish ad ban.</headline>

<p>The European toy industry's trade group welcomed on Wednesday the opinion of a legal adviser at the European Court of Justice that Sweden, which bans TV advertising aimed at children, cannot restrict commercials broadcast from another European Union member state.</p>
<p>Advocate-General Murray Jacobs issued an opinion on Tuesday saying the EU's Television without Frontiers directive &quot;prevents a member state from taking action against television advertisements broadcast from another member state&quot;.</p>
<p>Opinions by the Advocates-General are only advisory, but are often followed by the court in later rulings.</p>
<p>The Toy Manufacturers of Europe (TME), which says it represents 80 percent of the toy industry in Europe, said the opinion of Court's advocate general reinforces the &quot;crucial transmitting state principle.&quot;</p>
<p>Under this principle a commercial complying with the rules of the country where the broadcaster is established cannot be stopped by a country where the broadcast is received.</p>
<p>&quot;We welcome the advocate general's opinion as upholding the (EU) Television without Frontiers directive,&quot; said Peter Waterman, chairman of TME's broadcasting committee, in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;If the European Court of Justice will rule in accordance with the Advocate General's opinion, Sweden will be forced to stop imposing its national ban on television advertising to children on broadcasts from other member states,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The case involves an advertisement for a magazine about dinosaurs that publishing firm De Agostini Forlag AB aired on television channels TV3 and TV4 in 1993. TV3 is a British-based channel broadcasting to Sweden while TV4 is based in Sweden.</p>
<p>The Swedish Consumer Ombudsman, saying the advertisement should be banned, decided to take the firm to the Swedish Market Court, which asked for a preliminary ruling from the European Court.</p>
<p>TME said it expected a definite ruling from the European Court in a few months time. -- Brussels newsroom +32 2 287 68 11</p>
