<p>Vietnam has urged fellow members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to devise a plan of action aimed at curbing drug abuse and trafficking in the region, the official Vietnam News Agency said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Deputy Prime Minister Nguyen Khanh, speaking on the first day of a meeting of ASEAN drug enforcement officials in Hanoi, said Vietnam had failed in its efforts to put a brake on the drug trade.</p>
<p>&quot;Despite great efforts exerted by the government and the entire people, the country still saw increases in the number of drug smuggling, stockpiling and illegal production cases,&quot; Khanh was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>The five-day meeting has brought together officials from the ASEAN nations, Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.</p>
<p>Officials from Laos, Burma, Interpol, the United Nations Drug Control Programme (UNDCP) and the Bangkok-based Association of Narcotics Control Officers were also attending.</p>
<p>Drug smugglers have increasingly used Vietnam as a transit route to the West from the so-called &quot;Golden Triangle&quot; -- an opium-poppy growing zone where Burma, Laos and Thailand meet -- since Hanoi opened up to the outside world in the late 1980s.</p>
<p>Burma is the world's largest source of illegal opium and its refined form, heroin.</p>
<p>Khanh told delegates at the ASEAN meeting that Vietnam, a country of 75 million people, had nearly 190,000 drug addicts.</p>
<p>Drug abuse in schools was also a growing problem, with thousands of children becoming addicts.</p>
<p>A report in the state-run Lao Dong newspaper in May quoted an official in the northern border province of Lang Son as saying that traces of heroin had been found in urine samples from 17 out of 23 children.</p>
<p>Illegal opium cultivation still exists in some remote highland areas of Vietnam. However, a three-year-old poppy eradication campaign has cut the area under cultivation to 3,000 hectares (7,400 acres) from 20,000 hectares (49,400 acres).</p>
