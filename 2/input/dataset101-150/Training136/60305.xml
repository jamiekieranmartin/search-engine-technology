<p>Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole on Wednesday criticised the entertainment industry for glorifying drug use and unveiled a new anti-drug slogan -- &quot;Just say don't do it.&quot;</p>
<p>Speaking at a Catholic prep school that uses drug-sniffing dogs to help keep the campus drug-free, Dole sought to reignite a public crusade against drug use as well as his own struggling campaign.</p>
<p>&quot;I have a message to the fashion, music and film industries,&quot; he said. &quot;Take your influence seriously, you have a lot of it. Respect your talent and power. Stop the commercialization of drug abuse. Stop the glorification of slow suicide.&quot;</p>
<p>The speech was the latest salvo in Dole's effort to win votes with an anti-drugs, anti-crime programme launched on Monday in Philadelphia. The entertainment and fashion industries shared in the responsibility for shaping attitudes among teenagers, whose rates of drug use have more than doubled since 1992, Dole said.</p>
<p>&quot;The marijuana leaf and the heroin needle have become the symbols of fashionable rebellion, and two of the most widely praised movies of the past two years, 'Pulp Fiction' and 'Trainspotting' feature the romance of heroin,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Fashion magazines feature models with what is known as the 'junkie look.' Rock musicians create and celebrate a culture of heroin. And some have become role models, even in death,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Dole has seen neither &quot;Trainspotting,&quot; about Scottish heroin addicts living in squalor, or &quot;Pulp Fiction,&quot; about American heroin addicts living the fast life, Dole spokesman Nelson Warfield said. But he has read reviews of both films, including one citing &quot;Trainspotting&quot; as a &quot;funny, upbeat look at herion addiction,&quot; Warfield said.</p>
<p>Dole criticised President Bill Clinton for sowing &quot;moral confusion&quot; by making light of his own past, non-inhaling, expermentation with marijuana -- citing an MTV music television interview in which Clinton said he would inhale marijuana if given another chance.</p>
<p>He harkened back to the 1980's anti-drug campaign of former first lady Nancy Reagan, with its slogan &quot;Just say no,&quot; in leading the students in his new slogan, &quot;Just don't do it.&quot; The line also evokes Nike's shoe slogan, &quot;Just do it.&quot;</p>
<p>Dole also received the endorsement of the 7,000-member California Narcotics Officers Association, a another shot in the law-and-order endorsement battle with Clinton, who snared the backing of the 270,000 member Fraternal Order of Police.</p>
<p>Dole has criticised the entertainment industry before for contributing to a moral decline in America, but in July he cast his goals for the industry in a postitive light, going to California to thank filmmakers for several uplifting movies.</p>
<p>That was in recognition of the industry's importance in California, the largest state in terms of electoral votes.</p>
