<p>Roslan bin Mohd Sany was a 29-year-old Singaporean despatch rider whose luck ran out.</p>
<p>One evening in November 1994, he was stopped for a spot check by police who found 18.57 grams (0.62 ounces) of heroin hidden in 28 small packets on his person.</p>
<p>Convicted for drug trafficking after a trial, he was hanged on July 26.</p>
<p>Three other people convicted of drug offences were executed the same day, They included a Malaysian whose car yielded 793.5 gm (26.45 oz) of heroin stashed in the boot and the windscreen wipers.</p>
<p>Four more Singaporeans were executed the following Friday, again for violating the city-state's tough drug laws.</p>
<p>Of the nearly 270 people hanged for various crimes in the city-state since 1975, almost half were for drug-related charges.</p>
<p>Singapore has a mandatory death sentence for anyone over 18 years of age found guilty of trafficking in more than 15 gm (half an ounce) of heroin, 30 gm (an ounce) of morphine or 500 gm (18 oz) of cannabis or marijuana.</p>
<p>The only Westerner hanged for drug trafficking so far was Johannes van Damme, a 59-year old Dutch engineer. His execution in 1994 drew protests from the Netherlands and human rights groups.</p>
<p>Yet, despite the risk of a date with the hangman, drug traffickers and some addicts seem unfazed by Singapore's tough laws.</p>
<p>&quot;It is the thrill, this cat-and-mouse game, of trying to defy the law. You do it once and you get away with it, you will do it again and see if they (the police) will eventually get you,&quot; one addict said in a written reply to a set of questions.</p>
<p>He refused to meet reporters and declined to give personal details about how he became an addict.</p>
<p>The average daily population in Singapore's drug rehabilitation centres (DRCs) reached a record high of 8,700 in 1994, Ho Peng Kee, senior parliamentary secretary for Law and Home Affairs, said in a recent speech.</p>
<p>Ho said concerted government programmes like better treatment for addicts helped trim the number of drug abusers in DRCs, although he gave no figures.</p>
<p>&quot;While measures taken have helped to reduce the problem of heroin abuse, new threats have emerged,&quot; Ho said.</p>
<p>Police have carried out a series of raids on smart discotheques to round up users and dealers of the now fashionable drug Ecstasy, reputed to give the energy to dance all night.</p>
<p>&quot;We are now faced with so-called designer drugs such as Ecstasy which are abused by some party-goers in night spots,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>One enterprising trafficker tried to sneak Ecstasy pills into Singapore's Changi airport by using ingeniously crafted hiding places in airconditioners.</p>
<p>When Singapore police pried the units open after the consignee failed to turn up, they found thousands of pills.</p>
<p>Singaporean couriers involved in the business have also increased sharply over the last few years, the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) said.</p>
<p>The number of Singaporeans arrested for trafficking inside and outside the country shot up to 50 in 1995 from 34 in 1993, CNB figures showed.</p>
<p>&quot;The numbers have been increasing because drug trafficking is a lucrative trade,&quot; Masbollah Fazal, the CNB director, said in a written statement to Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;Also, because (of) our tough stand against the drug trade, Singaporeans as a whole are less likely to be suspected of drug trafficking. This is the flip side of our tough drug stand,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Heroin smuggled into the country would usually be packed into straws of various lengths, ranging from an inch-and-a-half (0.6 cm) long to about one foot (4.7 cm), legal sources said.</p>
<p>The price of the smaller packets range between Singapore $50 to over S$100 (US$35-$70), they said. Once hooked, addicts will normally try to peddle marijuana or Ecstasy pills to get more money to support their habit.</p>
<p>One trafficker made $200,000 on one deal and retired by buying two brothels, one source said. He did not say if the man was still in Singapore.</p>
<p>US$1-S$1.41</p>
