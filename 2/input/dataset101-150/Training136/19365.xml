<p>China's chief justice has lashed out at foreign influences that he says have led to a rise in hedonism and &quot;money-worship&quot; and allowed international drug cartels to bore their way into the nation's social fabric.</p>
<p>Ren Jianxin, president of the Supreme People's Court, warned that decadent capitalist ideology had seriously damaged social values, the Legal Daily reported on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Prostitution, drug addiction, drug trafficking and other ugly social phenomena are spreading and becoming more intense,&quot; he was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>International drug cartels were increasingly using China as a route for drug trafficking, and drugs were becoming a growing problem in several regions of the country.</p>
<p>The newspaper did not say where Ren made the remarks but an alarming rise in criminal activity has been a frequent theme of government and Communist Party officials of late.</p>
<p>China had nearly eradicated drugs and prostitution in the early years after the Communists took power. But economic reforms begun in 1979, which while raising living standards have also unleashed a resurgence of crime as the government relaxes its grip on society.</p>
<p>Ren said that between 1991 and 1995, China cracked more than 145,000 narcotics cases, seizing 17.1 tonnes of heroin, 10.8 tonnes of opium and 3.6 tonnes of marijuana.</p>
<p>He said that 46,000 people were arrested and that 7,000 of them were &quot;severely punished&quot;.</p>
<p>In the same period, police investigated 677,000 cases of prostitution, involving 1.34 million people.</p>
<p>Ren was quoted as saying that China must continue its struggle against crime.</p>
<p>&quot;We have the determination, the confidence and the means to eliminate these social evils,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Since the launch of a nationwide &quot;Strike Hard&quot; campaign in April this year to curb rising crime, China has arrested tens of thousands and executed more than 1,000 people.</p>
