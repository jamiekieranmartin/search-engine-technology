<p>Investigators arrested a senior police detective on Sunday in connection with their inquiries into Belgium's child sex scandal, Public Prosecutor Michel Bourlet said.</p>
<p>&quot;Georges Zicot was arrested and will be charged with truck theft, insurance fraud and document forgery,&quot; Bourlet told a news conference.</p>
<p>He said there had been searches at three sites on Sunday, including one at the Charleroi judicial police headquarters where Zicot worked.</p>
<p>Zicot, 45, is a specialist in tackling vehicle theft. Belgian media reported that he had been questioned twice in the past two years about thefts but released both times. He was promoted to chief detective earlier this year.</p>
<p>Bourlet said two other people had also been arrested. One was Gerard Pignon, the owner of a warehouse where stolen vehicles were allegedly stored. The other was insurer Thierry Dehaan.</p>
<p>Bourlet said the investigation into the vehicle theft ring would be added to the inquiry into the paedophile sex scandal in which five other people have already been arrested.</p>
<p>He said the connection was through Bernard Weinstein, an accomplice of convicted child rapist Marc Dutroux -- the central figure in the paedophile scandal that has sent shockwaves across Europe.</p>
<p>Weinstein was found dead last weekend alongside the bodies of eight-year-olds Julie Lejeune and Melissa Russo in a house belonging to Detroux, who said they starved to death earlier this year, nine months after being abducted in June 1995.</p>
<p>Two other girls have been rescued and police are hunting for at least two more who Dutroux has admitted kidnapping a year ago.</p>
<p>&quot;Dutroux has admitted killing Weinstein after a disagreement between the accomplices in an affair of truck theft,&quot; Bourlet said.</p>
<p>Another four people were also questioned at the weekend but had not been detained, Bourlet added.</p>
<p>Anne Thily, public prosecutor in the eastern city of Liege where Julie and Melissa lived, said this was a major case involving some 50 investigators -- including two from the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation.</p>
