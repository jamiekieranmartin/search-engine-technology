<p>Belgian television said one of two bodies found on Tuesday in the nation's child sex scandal was that of Eefje Lambrecks, abducted by Marc Dutroux a year ago.</p>
<p>&quot;A very good source has told us one of the bodies is that of Eefje,&quot; RTL television reported.  </p>
<p>The television said pathologists examining the corpses in Charleroi's Civic hospital were very close to identifying the second body.</p>
<p>Eefje Lambrecks, 19, and her friend An Marchal, 17, disappeared on August 22 last year in the Belgian port of Ostend.</p>
<p>The bodies were found on Tuesday under a shed in the garden of a house owned by Dutroux in the Jumet suburb of the southern city of Charleroi. The house was formerly occupied by Dutroux accomplice, Frenchman Bernard Weinstein.</p>
<p>Dutroux has admitted kidnapping them with Weinstein, whom he said he killed. The bodies of eight-year-olds Julie Lejeune and Melissa Russo were found two and a half weeks ago buried in another of Dutroux' six properties in the region. Two other young girls were rescued from a basement dungeon in another Dutroux house.</p>
