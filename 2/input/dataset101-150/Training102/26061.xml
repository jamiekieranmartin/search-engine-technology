<p>California's legislature passed a controversial bill on Friday that would make the state the first in the United States to require repeat child molesters to undergo &quot;chemical castration.&quot;</p>
<p>The state Assembly voted 51-8 for the bill, which had already easily passed the state Senate. It now goes to California Gov. Pete Wilson, a Republican, who has said he will sign it.</p>
<p>The bill's author, Republican Assemblyman Bill Hoge of Pasadena, expressed delight over the passage of the bill, which he said had received significant bipartisan support.</p>
<p>&quot;Child molestations are going to go down, and they are going to go down dramatically, because of this legislation,&quot; he said after the vote.</p>
<p>Hoge predicted California would set a trend and other states would soon adopt similar legislation. He said Californians were outraged by the &quot;horrible, heinous crime&quot; of child molestation and wanted something done about it.</p>
<p>Wilson's spokesman, Sean Walsh, said the governor would sign the bill. &quot;If it helps save one child, it's worth the effort,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Under the legislation, an offender convicted twice of molesting a child would, after his release, receive regular injections of a drug to reduce his sex drive unless he agreed to surgical castration.</p>
<p>Courts would have the discretion to order first-time offenders to undergo the treatment in particularly bad cases.</p>
<p>The bill is the latest tough anti-crime measure adopted by California. Two years ago the state passed a &quot;three strikes, you're out&quot; law mandating long sentences for career criminals.</p>
<p>The &quot;chemical castration&quot; measure has drawn opposition from civil rights advocates, who say it raises serious constitutional questions about the right to privacy and the right to procreate, and from some medical experts, who question whether the treatment will be effective in all cases.</p>
<p>&quot;We all want to protect our kids, but this bill isn't the way to do it,&quot; Valerie Small Navarro, a Sacramento lobbyist for the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), said. &quot;It gives the public a false sense of having solved a terrible problem.&quot;</p>
<p>Hoge said the drug treatment had been used in some European countries and was effective in reducing the high repeat rate of child molesters.</p>
<p>The term &quot;chemical castration&quot; is not strictly accurate, since the drug stops working after the patient stops taking it. Hoge had said offenders would be treated only while on parole, which lasts three years in child molestation cases.</p>
