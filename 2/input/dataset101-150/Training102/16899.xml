<p>Police prepared to use high-tech radar equipment as they searched late on Tuesday at a house owned by suspected Belgian child sex gang leader Marc Dutroux and last occupied by an accomplice he admits murdering.</p>
<p>The paedophile sex, porn and killings scandal has triggered an international debate on child sex abuse and prompted calls for the death sentence to be reinstated in Belgium.</p>
<p>Foreign experts assisted in the excavations on Tuesday after Dutroux, a convicted multiple child rapist, was brought to the house in handcuffs late on Monday and gave investigators hints on where to dig.</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing has been found so far. But the Bennett system will be deployed and we hope it will lead to discoveries,&quot; police captain Alain Bal told reporters outside the house.</p>
<p>Superintendent John Bennett is a British police officer who supervised excavations in the &quot;House of Horrors&quot; murder case in England two years ago which involved the use of sophisticated radar imaging equipment. He was brought in last week to help.</p>
<p>Police also brought in Harry Jongen, a Dutch airforce lieutenant who is able to find bodies with his extraordinary sense of smell.</p>
<p>&quot;Harry the Nose&quot; -- who has most recently put his skill to work in Bosnia -- pushes iron rods in the soil to trace bodies.</p>
<p>&quot;I smell the iron to see if there are human remains in the neighbourhood,&quot; Jongen told reporters in Jumet, a small village in the south of Belgium.</p>
<p>Bal said that Tuesday's operation was focused mainly on clearing debris from the house -- a run-down building in an old industrial neighbourhood -- in order to ready the house and its garden for the high-tech search equipment.</p>
<p>Reporters allowed briefly onto the scene saw several holes in the ground, covered with blue plastic to shield them from the rain, which hindered the work. The house ws cordoned off.</p>
<p>The house was formerly inhabited by Dutroux' accomplice, Frenchman Bernard Weinstein, whom Dutroux has admitted killing.</p>
<p>Dutroux led police to the bodies of eight-year-olds Melissa Russo and Julie Lejeune and of Weinstein 10 days ago. They were buried in the garden of one of Dutroux' five other houses in and around the city of Charleroi.</p>
<p>Dutroux told police the two girls starved to death earlier this year, nine months after they were kidnapped in June 1995.</p>
<p>Two other girls, Laetitia Delhez, 14, and Sabine Dardenne, 12, were rescued on August 15 from a dungeon in another of Dutroux' houses.</p>
<p>Dutroux has also admitted kidnapping teenagers An Marchal and Eefje Lambrecks a year ago. Police are still searching for them.</p>
<p>&quot;Dutroux is cooperating in the investigation, but I have the impression that he is making us go around in circles,&quot; public prosecutor Michel Bourlet told Reuters by telephone.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the national and international hunt for other missing Belgian children continues.</p>
<p>A Brussels police official told Reuters police were looking for at least three other Belgian girls who disappeared in the last five years. It was not known if Dutroux was involved.</p>
<p>Earlier on Tuesday Slovak police said they were cooperating with Belgian collegues in the search for An and Eefje.</p>
<p>They said Dutroux visited Slovakia a number of times and that about 10 young Slovak women went to Belgium at his invitation.</p>
<p>Separately, a court in Neufchateau on Tuesday confirmed the charges of criminal association against Michel Diakostavrianos and Claude Thirault, two men arrested in the Dutroux affair last week. In total 10 people have now been arrested in the case.</p>
