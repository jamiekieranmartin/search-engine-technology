<p>Former Stifel, Nicolaus &amp; Co investment banker Robert Cochran, who was scheduled to report Monday to an Oklahoma federal prison on a bid-rigging conviction, won an emergency delay of his jail term, Assistant U.S. Attorney Susan Cox said.</p>
<p>The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said on Sept 26 that it needed more time to review an August 1996 decision by U.S. District Judge Ralph Thompson to deny Cochran's release on bail pending appeal of his May 4 conviction, Cox said.</p>
<p>Cochran was to report to the El Reno Correction Institution in El Reno, Oklahoma at noon today, Cox said in a telephone interview.</p>
<p>Cochran attorneys have until Oct 15 to file legal briefs in Cochran's appeal, and federal prosecutors have until Oct. 30 to respond, Cox said.</p>
<p>Cochran lawyers then are to reply Nov 13, and oral arguments are set for the week of Nov 19, Cox said.</p>
<p>A federal jury May 4 convicted Cochran of eight out of 21 counts of cheating the Oklahoma City Airport Trust Authority and the Sisters of St. Mary Health Care Authority on bond deals authorized by the panels.</p>
<p>Cochran attorney Drew Neville was unavailable for comment.</p>
