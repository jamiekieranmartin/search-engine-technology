<p>Belgium reeled in horror from the discovery of the dead bodies of two more girls, taking the total so far to four, in the paedophile abduction, sexual abuse and murder case that has sparked an international hunt.</p>
<p>The badly decomposed bodies of teenagers An Marchal and Eefje Lambrecks were found on Tuesday buried in a metal container 2.5 metres under a shed in the garden of a house in Charleroi owned by convicted rapist Marc Dutroux.</p>
<p>Dutroux has admitted kidnapping the two on August 22 last year with accomplice Michel Lelievre who is also under arrest.</p>
<p>The house in the Jumet suburb of the city of Charleroi where they were found was formerly occupied by Frenchman Bernard Dutroux, an accomplice whom Dutroux admits killing and who he accuses of the murders.</p>
<p>Harry Jongen, a Dutch specialist in finding buried corpses who is helping Belgian police, said a credit card belonging to Dutroux was found with the bodies.</p>
<p>The girls were identified by a wristwatch belonging to Eefje, and their dental records. The bodies were taken in white coffins back to their home town of Hasselt late on Tuesday as Belgium went into mourning for the second time in two weeks.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene sent sent his condolences to the parents of the two and pledged to never let the fate of the girls be repeated.</p>
<p>&quot;This is truly monstrous. We must do everything we can to make sure this doesn't happen ever again,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Paul Marchal, An's father, said it was clear the girls had been dead for a considerable time. Belga news agency, citing official sources, said they had been dead since the autumn.</p>
<p>Tuesday's grim discovery followed that of the bodies of eight-year-olds Julie Lejeune and Melissa Russo and of Weinstein on August 17 at a house owned by Dutroux in Sars-La-Buissiere, south of Charleroi.</p>
<p>Dutroux said the two children, abducted in June 1995, starved to death earlier this year. They were buried in what amounted to a state funeral in Liege on August 22.</p>
<p>Two other girls, Laetitia Delhez and Sabine Dardenne, were rescued from another of Dutroux's houses 12 days ago. Both had been sexually abused.</p>
<p>The governor of Arlon jail where Dutroux is being held said he was being monitored every seven and a half minutes, day and night, to stop him committing suicide.</p>
<p>British &quot;House of Horrors&quot; serial killer Fred West hung himself in jail before he could be tried.</p>
<p>Several other Belgian girls have gone missing in recent years. Their files are all now pooled in Neufchateau, nerve centre of the international paedophile investigation.</p>
<p>The discovery of the paedophile web has stunned the country, prompted the government to tighten rules on early release of sex offenders and triggered calls for a global war against the child sex trade.</p>
<p>The fact that Dutroux was released early from a 13-year sentence for child rape, and that he has fathered three children by his two wives, has bewildered adults and children alike.</p>
<p>There have also been allegations of police bungling or worse. One of the people held is chief detective Georges Zicot.</p>
<p>The hunt for missing girls has spread well beyond Belgium's borders. Investigators have visited Slovakia and the Czech Republic and contacted colleagues in Austria and Germany.</p>
<p>Authorities in Bratislava suspect Dutroux of the murder of a Slovak woman and the planned kidnapping of at least one other.</p>
<p>Nine people are now under arrest in the Belgian affair, including Dutroux's second wife Michelle Martin.</p>
<p>Police have found trench-like cells allegedly for holding kidnapped children in one of Dutroux's houses and seized more than 300 paedophile porn video tapes -- some featuring Dutroux himself -- plus magazines, childrens clothing and a gun.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, as the bodies of An and Eefje were being unearthed, police began new searches in Keumiee near Namur and Jemappe-sur-Sambre near Charleroi -- the former home of Dutroux' parents. There were no immediate results.</p>
