<p>Heavy rain delayed a second day of digging by Belgian police investigating a child sex and kidnapping scandal on Wednesday as they searched for bodies at a house owned by chief suspect Marc Dutroux.</p>
<p>Speculation grew in the Belgian media about the possibility of five bodies at the site, including those of teenagers An Marchal and Eefje Lambrecks whom Dutroux says he kidnapped a year ago from the port of Ostend. Their fate remains unknown.</p>
<p>&quot;The unbearable wait,&quot; wrote popular daily La Derniere Heure across its front page above pictures of Marchal's parents, looking strained, and of searches at the house in Jumet, southern Belgium, on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Expecting the worst,&quot; exclaimed Vers L'Avenir. &quot;Concern for the lot of missing girls grows,&quot; Flemish daily the Standaard declared.</p>
<p>Late on Tuesday darkness forced police to suspend their excavations at the house which was formerly occupied by Dutroux' dead accomplice Bernard Weinstein.</p>
<p>Work had been due to resume at nine a.m. (0700 GMT) on Wednesday, but a Reuter reporter on the scene said the start appeared to have been delayed by rain.</p>
<p>Dutroux, a convicted child rapist and unemployed father of three, led police 11 days ago to the bodies of eight-year-olds Julie Lejeune and Melissa Russo in the garden of another of the six houses he owns around the southern city of Charleroi.</p>
<p>The body of Weinstein, whom Dutroux admits to killing, was buried at the same site.</p>
<p>A chief police detective has also been arrested on fraud charges, prompting allegations of police bungling or a possible high-level cover-up.</p>
<p>Dutroux said the two girls starved to death early this year, nine months after being abducted in June 1995. He denies killing them but admits paying two accomplices 40,000 francs ($1,300) to kidnap the two friends.</p>
<p>They were buried on Thursday amid an outpouring of grief across Europe and some calls for the reinstatement of the death penalty.</p>
<p>Foreign experts assisted in the excavations on Tuesday after Dutroux, 39, was taken to the house in handcuffs and suggested sites to dig. Prosecutor Michel Bourlet said Dutroux was a calculating and highly manipulative personality.</p>
<p>Superintendent John Bennett, the British police officer who supervised excavations in the Fred and Rosemary West murder case in England two years ago using sophisticated radar imaging equipment, was brought in last week to help.</p>
<p>Two other girls, Laetitia Delhez, 14, and Sabine Dardenne, 12, were rescued on August 15 from a makeshift dungeon in another of Dutroux' houses.</p>
<p>So far 10 people have been arrested in what has now become known as the &quot;Dutroux Affair&quot;.</p>
<p>Dutroux and associate Michel Lelievre have been charged with abduction and illegal imprisonment. Dutroux' second wife Michelle Martin has been charged as an accomplice. Seven others face charges of criminal association.</p>
<p>At least 15 children have gone missing in Belgium in the past six years. To date seven have been found dead, two have been rescued and six are still officially listed as missing.</p>
<p>A Brussels police official told Reuters police were looking for at least three other Belgian girls who have disappeared in the last five years. It was not known if Dutroux was involved.</p>
<p>On Tuesday Slovak police said they were cooperating with Belgian collegues in the search for An and Eefje. They said Dutroux visited Slovakia a number of times and that about 10 young Slovak women went to Belgium at his invitation.</p>
