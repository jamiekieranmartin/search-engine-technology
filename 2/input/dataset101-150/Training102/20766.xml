<p>Speculation mounted that Belgium's child sex and porn scandal might turn into an echo of Britain's &quot;House of Horrors&quot; mass murders as police rifled the house once occupied by Bernard Weinstein, murdered by Belgian gang leader Marc Dutroux.</p>
<p>Belgian media speculated about the possibility of five bodies at the site, including those of An Marchal and Eefje Lambrecks who Dutroux says he kidnapped a year ago from the port of Ostend. Their fate remains unknown.</p>
<p>Dutroux, a convicted child rapist and unemployed father of three, led police 10 days ago to the bodies of eight-year-olds Julie Lejeune and Melissa Russo in the garden of one of the six houses he owns around the southern city of Charleroi.</p>
<p>The case, which has also involved the arrest of a chief police detective on Sunday on fraud charges, has prompted allegations of police bungling or a possible high-level cover-up.</p>
<p>Dutroux said the two girls starved to death early this year, nine months after being abducted in June 1995. He denies killing them but admits paying two accomplices 40,000 francs ($1,300) for kidnapping the two friends.</p>
<p>They were buried on Thursday to an outpouring of grief across Europe and some calls for reinstatement of the death penalty.</p>
<p>Foreign experts assisted in the excavations on Tuesday after Dutroux, 39, was taken to the house in handcuffs and suggested sites to dig.</p>
<p>Proscecutor Michel Bourlet said Dutroux was a calculating and highly manipulative personality.</p>
<p>Superintendent John Bennett, the British police officer who supervised excavations in the Fred and Rosemary West murder case in England two years ago which involved the use of sophisticated radar imaging equipment, was brought in last week to help.</p>
<p>Dutroux led police to the bodies of Melissa, Julie and Weinstein 10 days ago. They were buried in the garden of one of Dutroux' five other houses in and around the city of Charleroi.</p>
<p>Two other girls, Laetitia Delhez, 14, and Sabine Dardenne, 12, were rescued on August 15 from a makeshift dungeon in another of Dutroux' houses. Dutroux has also admitted kidnapping teenagers An Marchal and Eefje Lambrecks a year ago. Police are still searching for them.</p>
<p>So far 10 people have been arrested in what has now become known as the &quot;Dutroux Affair&quot;.</p>
<p>Dutroux and associate Michel Lelievre have been charged with abduction and illegal imprisonment. Dutroux' second wife Michelle Martin has been charged as an accomplice. Seven others face charges of criminal association.</p>
<p>The case has given an injection of adrenalin to the hunt for other missing Belgian children.</p>
<p>At least 15 children have gone missing in Belgium in the past six years. To date seven have been found dead, two have been rescued and six are still officially listed as missing.</p>
<p>A Brussels police official told Reuters police were looking for at least three other Belgian girls who have disappeared in the last five years. It was not known if Dutroux was involved.</p>
<p>On Tuesday Slovak police said they were cooperating with Belgian collegues in the search for An and Eefje.</p>
<p>They said Dutroux visited Slovakia a number of times and that about 10 young Slovak women went to Belgium at his invitation.</p>
<p>A court in Neufchateau on Tuesday confirmed the charges of criminal association against Michel Diakostavrianos and Claude Thirault, two men arrested in the Dutroux affair last week. In total 10 people have now been arrested in the case.</p>
