<p>The European Commission urged EU governments on Wednesday to set aside doubts about the bloc's role in fighting cross-border crime in the interests of stamping out vice-trafficking in children and women.</p>
<p>Ahead of a two-day gathering of EU justice ministers in Dublin, commissioners stressed the group had a crucial coordinating role in combating the vice trade, thrown into a world spotlight by a Belgian child murder and sex scandal.</p>
<p>The call was backed by Ireland, which as EU president will host the meeting, starting on Thursday.</p>
<p>European Union member states, jealous of their own police and judicial systems, have so far been reluctant to extend the EU's competence to fighting cross-border crime, which also involves drugs, cars and nuclear materials and money laundering.</p>
<p>&quot;Without these kinds of cooperation, the calls of many...for action to be taken cannot be met in an effective way,&quot; Irish Justice Minister Nora Owen told a European Parliament committee on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The bodies of two young Belgian girls, kidnapped from their Liege homes in June 1995, were found in August in a property owned by a convicted rapist in south Belgium. They had been starved to death.</p>
<p>The bodies of two other young women, abducted in August 1995 from the Belgian seaside town of Ostend, were found on another property associated with the man three weeks ago.</p>
<p>Two other girls were rescued, and the ensuing investigation revealed links between the Belgian ring and the Czech Republic and Slovakia and links with trafficking in stolen cars.</p>
<p>Officials believe the fate of the four girls exposes a deeper problem of international trafficking in kidnapped children, discussed at a world conference in Stockholm in August.</p>
<p>The Dublin meeting will examine an action plan by Belgium's Justice Minister Stefaan de Clerck to harmonise criminal and procedural law and legal cooperation at an international level.</p>
<p>It would also involve exchange and training of vice squad staffs and creation a directory of police expertise.</p>
<p>At the meeting the EU's Justice Commissioner Anita Gradin will outline the Commission's work to date on fighting trade in women and children and urge EU members to ratify a convention that will fully deploy the EU's police agency Europol.</p>
<p>Ireland wants agreement at the meeting on a plan to expand the role of Europol to specifically fight the trade in people. This would involve setting up a central database of missing children, as demanded by the European Parliament.</p>
<p>&quot;Without international cooperation a comprehensive list of missing children cannot be drawn up,&quot; said Owen.</p>
