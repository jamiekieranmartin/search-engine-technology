<p>Whether victims of kidnap or tugs of love, runaways or accident cases, Europe's missing children can hold out little hope of help from European Union countries as things stand.</p>
<p>So says Ireland's Mary Banotti, the European Parliament's mediator for abducted children, who believes that so disorganised is the 15-nation Union that it is not even able to say exactly how many children are missing at a given time, never mind help to find them.</p>
<p>&quot;Children go missing for a variety of reasons, some are parentally abducted, some are runaways often from abusive and violent homes, some from problems as minor as difficulties in their schools,&quot; Banotti told the Parliament recently.</p>
<p>&quot;Some children are criminally abducted and never found. Some children disappear because they have fatal accidents...What is clear is that the law in all our countries has not kept up with the increasingly horrific crimes against children,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>EU justice and home affairs ministers will have a brainstorming session on how to attack the problem when they meet in Dublin on Thursday for a two-day meeting.</p>
<p>Banotti says a centralised database of missing children run by the EU's police agency Europol and a register of paedophiles are needed to broach a long-standing problem thrown into the spotlight by the discovery of four murdered children in Belgium.</p>
<p>The world reacted with horror when the bodies of Julie Lejeune and Melissa Russo, kidnapped from their Liege homes in June 1995, were found on August 17, 1996 in a property owned by convicted rapist Marc Dutroux in south Belgium.</p>
<p>They had starved to death.</p>
<p>The bodies of Eefje Lambrecks and An Marchal, abducted in August 1995 from the Belgian seaside town of Ostend, were found on another property associated with Dutroux three weeks ago.</p>
<p>Banotti, who started out helping to find children abducted by one of their parents when their cross-border marriages went wrong, says the database might not have helped Julie and Melissa, as in that case the problem was close to home.</p>
<p>But it could help with a problem which is growing as the EU relaxes its borders.</p>
<p>&quot;Those who have children can pass easily through our borders. This is now a Europe-wide issue,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>In the United States, the National Institution for Missing and Exploited Children has a register of more than 367,000 missing children. But the EU, bogged down by a plethora of different police forces, has no idea of how many children are lost, Banotti says.</p>
<p>Ahead of the Dublin ministerial meeting, EU justice Commissioner Anita Gradin has expressed support for Banotti's plan for a database of missing children under 16, to be run by a strengthened Europol.</p>
<p>She told Reuters she would urge EU members to ratify urgently the convention which will put Europol fully to work.</p>
<p>Until the convention making the Hague-based agency fully operational is ratified it can not carry out vital work pooling and analysing information and thus help the fight against the world trade in child-sex and child pornography.</p>
<p>In a sign of how difficult it might be to implement some of the steps Banotti is demanding, Green Euro-deputies last week blocked a parliamentary call for a centralised register of known paedophiles on civil liberties grounds.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe that in the light of the recent events that it would be appropriate to have a centralised register of convicted paedophiles. In that way there can be some form of monitoring in relation to these people,&quot; Banotti said.</p>
<p>She defends her idea on civil liberties grounds too, saying it would not give detailed information and could only be consulted by the police and potential employers like schools and children's homes which give privileged access to children.</p>
<p>Banotti is also seeking a clampdown of use of the Internet, saying paedophile gangs have made a better use of the World Wide Web to promote their trade than security forces have in trying to catch them.</p>
<p>She also supports calls for the extended use of extraterritorial law, where Europeans who travel overseas to indulge in sex with children can be prosecuted back home.</p>
