<p>Investigators probing Belgium's scandal of child kidnapping, sexual abuse and murder questioned several policemen after raids on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Assistant Public Prosecutor Jean-Paul Pavanello said 15 premises searched around the southern city of Charleroi included an office occupied by the city's judicial police.</p>
<p>In a case that has stunned Belgium, police last month rescued two young girls abducted by convicted rapist Marc Dutroux and accomplice Michel Lelievre and unearthed the bodies of four more as well as that of Frenchman Bernard Weinstein.</p>
<p>King Albert made the unprecedented move on Tuesday of stepping into national judicial affairs when he asked Justice Minister Stefaan De Clerck to make sure the scandal was solved.</p>
<p>The Royal couple came in for bitter criticism from the parents of eight-year-olds Julie Lejeune and Melissa Russo -- found dead on August 17 in a property owned by Dutroux -- for not pushing the police to investigate fully the disappearance of their children.</p>
<p>Those questioned on Tuesday included eight members of the judicial police and three gendarmes, along with 12 people close to chief detective Georges Zicot, arrested two weeks ago during investigations into Dutroux' child porn and car theft gang.</p>
<p>Pavanello said the questioning was over car thefts and the murder of Weinstein, an accomplice whom Dutroux admits killing. He said police were finding growing links between the child sex case and the car thefts.</p>
<p>Since the investigations began on August 9 with the abduction of 14-year-old Laetitia Delhez -- one of the two girls rescued six days later from home-made dungeon in a house owned by Dutroux -- 10 people have been arrested and charged.</p>
<p>Pavanello told Reuters no arrest warrants were issued on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Detective Zicot appeared in court in Liege on Tuesday to appeal against charges of car theft, insurance fraud and forgery.</p>
<p>Insurance fraud investigator Thierry Dehaan, who has also been charged with fraud and forgery, was in court alongside Zicot. Gerrard Pinon, charged with handling stolen goods, has not appealed and was not in court, Pavanello said.</p>
<p>Belga news agency said a ruling was due Thursday or Friday.</p>
<p>In Neufchateau, nerve centre of the international paedophile pornography ring hunt, charges against Annie Bouty of criminal association were formally confirmed.</p>
<p>Bouty, a disbarred lawyer, is the former companion of Jean-Michel Nihoul a Brussels businessman who has been charged with criminal association relating to the sex abuse and pornorgaphy side of the investigations.</p>
<p>Dutroux, Lelievre and Dutroux' second wife Michelle Martin -- charged as an accomplice -- are due to appear in court on Friday to have the charges against them renewed.</p>
<p>Authorities in Bratislava suspect Dutroux of the murder of a Slovak woman and the planned kidnapping of at least one other.</p>
<p>Belgium went into mourning for the second time in as many weeks at the weekend as Dutroux gang victims Eefje Lambrecks and An Marchal were buried in their home town of Hasselt.</p>
<p>They had been found under a shed on a property formerly occupied by Weinstein.</p>
<p>On August 22 the bodies of Julie Lejeune and Melissa Russo -- who had starved to death in a Dutroux property southwest of Charleroi -- were buried in Liege.</p>
<p>A gendarmerie spokesman said police would end their searches at the property later on Tuesday and move their attention on Wednesday to a house in the Marchienne-au-Pont suburb of Charleroi and another in the Ixelles suburb of Brussels.</p>
<p>At least seven other Belgian youngsters are still missing -- some for several years.</p>
<p>The hunt for missing girls and cars is international. Investigators have visited Slovakia and the Czech Republic and contacted Police in Austria, Germany and Poland.</p>
