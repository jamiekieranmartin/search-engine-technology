<p>Belgian children returned to school on Monday after the summer break in a grim mood over the deaths from starvation of two eight-year-old girls while in the hands of a paedophile sex gang.</p>
<p>As the schools reopened police began fresh searches for bodies and clues at four of the six houses in and around the southern city of Charleroi owned by convicted child rapist Marc Dutroux, key suspect in an affair that has shaken Europe.</p>
<p>&quot;I find what they did disgusting. We should do the same to them,&quot; one young girl at a small school in the village of Herbeumont told RTBF television. &quot;They should be killed.&quot;</p>
<p>Claudy Labiouse, the school's head teacher, handed out sheets of paper to the children for them to write down their feelings or questions about the scandal.</p>
<p>At some schools in the Flemish part of the country pupils turned up wearing white T-shirts as a gesture of solidarity with two other girls -- An Marchal and Eefje Lambrecks -- who Dutroux admits kidnapping a year ago. The girls' fate remains a mystery.</p>
<p>Dutroux led police on August 17 to the bodies of eight-year-olds Julie Lejeune and Melissa Russo in the garden of a house he owns in Sars-La-Buissiere, south west of Charleroi.</p>
<p>Two days earlier police had rescued Laetitia Delhez, 14, and Sabine Dardenne, 12, from a basement dungeon in Dutroux' house in another Charleroi suburb. Both had been sexually abused.</p>
<p>On Monday, following new leads, police resumed digging at Dutroux' house in the Charleroi suburb of Jumet formerly occupied by Frenchman Bernard Weinstein and in the next door house he used for eight months where they found new-turned soil.</p>
<p>Dutroux admits murdering Weinstein, an accomplice. His body was found next to Julie and Melissa.</p>
<p>&quot;During the weekend we established that between September 1995 and April 1996 Bernard Weinstein occupied this neighbouring house&quot;, Gendarmerie spokesman Major Jean-Marie Boudin said.</p>
<p>&quot;In the garden as well as in the cellar, we have found places where the earth has been turned. One in the cellar and one in the garden. We will investigate further,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Investigators using special British radar-imaging equipment to locate underground cavities that may contain bodies, found two &quot;hot spots&quot; in the cellar of the Dutroux' house on Friday.</p>
<p>Police demolished a shed in the garden where they spent three days digging last week, and began excavating the whole area to a depth of five metres (yards).</p>
<p>Investigators also emptied another Dutroux house in the Charleroi suburb of Marchienne-au-Pont, the home of Michel Lelievre who like Dutroux has been charged with abduction and illegal imprisonment of children.</p>
<p>Trench-like cells have been found in the cellar.</p>
<p>The discovery of the web of paedophile abduction has horrified the country, prompted the government to tighten the rules on early release of sex offenders and triggered calls for a global war against the child sex trade.</p>
<p>The fact that Dutroux was released early from a 13-year sentence for child rape, and that he has fathered three children by his two wives, has bewildered adults and children alike.</p>
<p>The hunt for missing girls has crossed frontiers. Belgian police have visited Slovakia and the Czech Republic and have contacted colleagues in Austria and Germany.</p>
<p>Dutroux is a suspect in Bratislava in the murder of a Slovak woman and the planned kidnapping of at least one other.</p>
<p>Nine people are now under arrest in the Belgian affair including Dutroux's second wife Michelle Martin.</p>
<p>The international nature of disappearances was illustrated at the weekend when police searching for two teenage girls who went missing late on Thursday near Liege found them in the German city of Cologne. It was unclear what had happened but police were treating it as attempted kidnapping.</p>
