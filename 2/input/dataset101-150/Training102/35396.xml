<p>Police made their tenth arrest in Belgium's scandal of child kidnapping, sex abuse, killing and car theft on Thursday as the country prepared to bury two young girl victims of the gang and searches for more bodies continued.</p>
<p>Annie Bouty, companion of Jean-Michel Nihoul who has been charged with criminal association, was arrested after questioning by investigators in the Neufchateau nerve centre of the international paedophile hunt, a gendarmerie official said.</p>
<p>Teenagers Eefje Lambrecks and her friend An Marchal, unearthed by police on Tuesday, will be buried on Saturday after separate church services in their home town of Hasselt, eastern Belgium, a city official said.</p>
<p>The bodies of the girls were found in a metal container beneath a shed on the grounds of a house in the Jumet suburb of the city of Charleroi belonging to convicted child rapist Marc Dutroux, who admits kidnapping them in August 1995.</p>
<p>The house was formerly occupied by Frenchman Bernard Weinstein, an accomplice whom Dutroux admits killing and who he accuses of murdering the two.</p>
<p>Belgium has been in shock and mourning since August 15 when Laetitia Delhez, 14, and Sabine Dardenne, 12, were rescued from a do-it-yourself dungeon in another house owned by Dutroux in the Marcinelle suburb of Charleroi.</p>
<p>The bodies of eight-year-olds Julie Lefeune and Melissa Russo were found dead from starvation two days later in a house owned by Dutroux in Sars-La-Buisierre south west of the city.</p>
<p>They were buried in the city of Liege amid a national outpouring of grief on August 22 -- the anniversary of the abduction of An and Eefje.</p>
<p>On Thursday police resumed searches at Sars-La-Buissiere and some of the more than 11 locations either owned by or connected to Dutroux -- including one in Brussels.</p>
<p>&quot;Investigation of the Jumet grounds have ended, but more searches of the house are possible, and investigations are continuing in other places,&quot; Assistant Neufchateau Magistrate Jean-Paul Pavanello told Reuters.</p>
<p>At least seven other Belgian girls have gone missing in recent years. Their files are all now pooled in Neufchateau.</p>
<p>Discovery of the child sex abuse web stunned the country, forced tougher rules on early release of sex offenders and prompted calls for a global war against the child sex trade.</p>
<p>The fact that Dutroux was released early from a 13-year sentence for child rape, and that he has fathered three children by his two wives, has bewildered adults and children alike.</p>
<p>There have also been allegations of police bungling or worse.</p>
<p>One of the people held is chief detective Georges Zicot, charged with car theft, insurance fraud and forgery. He has been linked to Weinstein and police are investigating the child abduction and car theft cases together.</p>
<p>The hunt for missing girls has spread well beyond Belgium's borders. Investigators have visited Slovakia and the Czech Republic and contacted colleagues in Austria and Germany.</p>
<p>Authorities in Bratislava suspect Dutroux of the murder of a Slovak woman and the planned kidnapping of at least one other.</p>
<p>Dutroux and associate Michel Lelievre have been charged in Belgium with abduction and illegal imprisonment. Dutroux's second wife Michelle Martin has been charged as an accomplice.</p>
<p>Nihoul, who has admitted vaguely knowing Dutroux, has been accused by a girl who was sexually abused by her stepfather of also abusing her. She recognised him from television pictures.</p>
<p>Police have found trench-like cells in one of Dutroux's houses and seized hundreds of pornographic paedophile video tapes -- some featuring Dutroux himself -- plus magazines, childrens clothing and a gun.</p>
