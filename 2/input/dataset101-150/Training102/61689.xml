<p>Pressure mounted on Wednesday for cross-border action by the European Union to fight child sex abuse and trafficking networks with Irish Prime Minister John Bruton and Euro-MPs adding their voices to calls for action.</p>
<p>Bruton condemned as &quot;obscene&quot; the murders of four girls in Belgium and pledged to push for EU action to coordinate police work to fight such crimes.</p>
<p>&quot;Recent events brought home to us all the obscene and shocking crimes perpetrated against children on our continent,&quot; Bruton said in a speech to the European Parliament.</p>
<p>Ireland, as current EU president, has put the issue towards the top of its agenda in the wake of Belgium's unfolding story of child kidnapping, sexual abuse and murder.</p>
<p>Belgian police have arrested nine people since August, including convicted child rapist Marc Dutroux, in an affair which has revolted the country and raised questions of police bungling and political cover-up.</p>
<p>Charges range from illegal kidnapping of children, to vehicle theft and criminal association.</p>
<p>&quot;The Irish Presidency is working closely with the other member states to draw up measures at EU level to deal with this most evil of crimes,&quot; Bruton said.</p>
<p>Proposed action includes a possible extension of powers available to Europol, the bloc's embryonic police force.</p>
<p>&quot;Adoption of this proposal, at the earliest opportunity, will be a matter of the highest priority,&quot; Bruton said.</p>
<p>Irish Euro-MP Mary Banotti repeated a call she first made in July for the creation of an EU database carrying details of missing children.</p>
<p>&quot;My proposal has proved to be tragically prophetic,&quot; she said in a speech released to reporters ahead of delivery.</p>
<p>&quot;What is clear is that the law in all our countries has not kept up with both the increasingly horrific crimes against children and the sophistication and evil with which those who prey on children have succeeded.</p>
<p>&quot;If we can respond clearly and effectively to the challenge presented to us, I believe we will provide a fitting memorial to the little girls who were so brutally murdered in Belgium,&quot; said the Irish Christian Democrat (Fine Gael) deputy.</p>
<p>Other ideas being floated during Wednesday's parliamentary debate included creation of a European register of paedophiles and inclusion of childrens' rights clauses in pending EU treaty revisions.</p>
<p>The debate comes after last Friday's plea by European Justice Commissioner Anita Gradin for the EU's 15 countries to end their foot-dragging over the issue.</p>
<p>She said an urgent ratification of the Europol Convention to launch the Hague-based police agency was one concrete way they could fight the child-sex trade which has shocked the world.</p>
<p>&quot;Everyone should go home and ratify the Europol Convention. If we want to get hold of these gangs who are stealing, abducting children then you need a Europol that's effective,&quot; she told Reuters in an interview.</p>
<p>Among the ideas Gradin will float at a Dublin meeting of EU justice and home affairs ministers on September 26-27 are that countries should try people who travel abroad to buy child sex.</p>
<p>The move would follow through on some of the good intentions expressed at a world conference on the issue in Stockholm last month.</p>
