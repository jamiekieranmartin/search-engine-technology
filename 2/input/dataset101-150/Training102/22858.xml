<p>Finnish police said on Thursday they had arrested two men suspected of sexually abusing a captive 13-year-old girl, but did not believe the case was linked to others in Europe.</p>
<p>The men, both Finns aged about 40, were arrested last Saturday in the western town of Tampere in a raid on a luxury boat owned by one of them.</p>
<p>The girl was being held on the boat and had sought help from a passer-by, police chief inspector Ilkka Laasonen said.</p>
<p>&quot;This is an individual case and I don't have any evidence linking the suspects to any other cases,&quot; Laasonen said.</p>
<p>The girl was taken to hospital. The men could face charges carrying up to six to 10 years in prison, he said.</p>
<p>Witnesses had reported seeing many young women and some girls who looked clearly underage at parties around the boat in recent weeks, the daily newspaper Iltalehti said.</p>
