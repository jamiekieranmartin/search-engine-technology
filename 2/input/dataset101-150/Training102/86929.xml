<p>Sweden is to become the first country in Europe to introduce a nationwide scheme that will allow low-risk offenders to serve their jail sentences at home, watched over by an electronic big brother.</p>
<p>Over the past two years, certain offenders in six districts have been able to opt out of serving their time in jail, choosing instead to be tagged by an electronic anklet and follow a strict timetable set by the probation service.</p>
<p>Probation officer Maria Lofgren said the trial had been so successful that Sweden's Prison and Probation Administration has decided to extend the scheme to cover the whole country from January 1.</p>
<p>&quot;It really is far more economical if people can stay at home,&quot; Lofgren told Reuters. &quot;It can also be better that low-risk offenders don't meet all the other prisoners who are more deeply involved in criminal activities.&quot;</p>
<p>Sweden is one of several countries, including Britain, the Netherlands, the United States, and Canada, that are looking at electronic surveillance of prisoners as a cheap alternative to locking up low risk offenders.</p>
<p>So far about 700 people have taken part in the Swedish scheme, which started on August 1, 1994. It was open to people with prison sentences of two months or less.</p>
<p>One participant is 21-year-old Axel (not his real name), a mechanic from Malmo in southern Sweden, who was given a two month jail term and banned from driving for two years after driving home drunk after a party.</p>
<p>Every weekday, Axel leaves his home at 8.15 am precisely and returns at 5.45 pm on the dot each night.</p>
<p>At the weekends he is allowed out for an hour a day.</p>
<p>If he departs from this schedule he risks setting off alarms in a nearby monitor centre and could be taken off the scheme.</p>
<p>&quot;Thanks to this scheme I have been able to carry on working and keep up with my normal life,&quot; said Axel told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;I have to watch the clock all the time but it's far better than being locked away.&quot;</p>
<p>More than half the prisoners on the scheme have been convicted on drink-driving offences. Seventeen percent were convicted for assault and the rest for theft, fraud, embezzlement, drug offences and refusing to undertake an alternative to military service.</p>
<p>The nationwide scheme, which will involve about 5,000 people over a year, will be expanded to allow anyone with a jail sentence of up to three months to apply for the scheme.</p>
<p>The Department of Justice is considering extending the scheme to offenders with a sentence of less than a year, a move which would take in about 85 percent of the 14,000 or so prisoners sentenced to jail in Sweden each year.</p>
<p>Ulf Johnsson, national project coordinator at Sweden's Prison and Probation Administration, said the costs of home imprisonment were far lower than incarceration, even taking into account the regular home visits needed.</p>
<p>He said it could even lead to the closure of several Swedish prisons in coming years.</p>
<p>&quot;Electronic tagging costs about 450 crowns ($68) a day per prisoner whereas it costs about 1,000 crowns a day to keep an offender in an open prison,&quot; Johnsson told Reuters.</p>
<p>Johnsson said there were several criteria for accepting an offender on the scheme.</p>
<p>They must have a suitable home with electricity and a telephone, as a receiver is installed in the home and connected to the electric mains and the phone system.</p>
<p>Signals from a small transmitter on the offender's anklet are relayed several times a minute to a host computer at the probation office in which offenders' daily plans are stored.</p>
<p>If people on the trial depart from the timetable, drink alcohol or take any illegal drug, they risk being taken off the scheme and serving the rest of their sentence in jail.</p>
<p>&quot;We have only had to terminate about seven percent of the cases who have attended the project, usually for people caught drinking alcohol,&quot; Johnsson said.</p>
<p>&quot;Someone who kept oversleeping also had to be taken off the scheme, but that's unusual. We have also caught people trying to manipulate the monitoring equipment.</p>
<p>&quot;It is of great interest among prisoners and more than 70 percent of the total target group have applied to join the scheme, which is voluntary.&quot;</p>
<p>But while the trial in Sweden has been hailed a success, electronic tagging has not been as popular in other countries.</p>
<p>The scheme has been criticised as a soft option in the handful of U.S. states where it has been tried. A major federal study also declared it useless as a deterrent.</p>
<p>In Britain, trials are underway in three areas -- Reading, just outside London, Norfolk in the east of the country, and Greater Manchester in the north -- but have also come under sharp criticism for excessive leniency.</p>
<p>Lofgren said a vital part of the project was regular, random home visits.</p>
<p>&quot;You do have to conduct regular visits as well as the electronic monitoring so maybe this is where other countries have gone wrong,&quot; she said. ($=6.61 Swedish crown)</p>
