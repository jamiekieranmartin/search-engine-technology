<p>Police searching for the bodies of missing girls in Belgium's child sex scandal found &quot;hot spots&quot; on Friday in houses owned by the chief suspect.</p>
<p>A senior detective arrested last Sunday in connection with the investigations appeared in court.</p>
<p>Gendarmerie spokesman Major Jean-Marie Boudin told reporters in the Charleroi suburb of Jumet that investigators using British radar-imaging equipment had found two &quot;hot spots&quot; in one house and one in another.</p>
<p>Both houses are owned by convicted child rapist and father of three Marc Dutroux, the chief suspect in the case of paedophile abduction, porn and death that has horrified Europe.</p>
<p>&quot;Now we are using only the British apparatus in the cellar of the Jumet house,&quot; Boudin told reporters. &quot;Up to now this apparatus has indicated two places of interest in the cellar.&quot;</p>
<p>He added that the equipment had also found an &quot;anomaly&quot; in a house in the Charleroi suburb of Marcinelle.</p>
<p>The British radar-imaging equipment is triggered by cavities underground. In Britain's &quot;House of Horrors&quot; case it was set off by underground holes which were found to contain bodies.</p>
<p>In two weeks of searching police have so far discovered the bodies of eight-year-olds Julie Lejeune and Melissa Russo in the garden of another of Dutroux's houses in Sars-La-Buissiere near Charleroi.</p>
<p>They have rescued two other sexually abused girls -- Laetitia Delhez and Sabine Dardenne -- from a dungeon in the Marcinelle house and are searching for at least two others -- An Marchal and Eefje Lambrecks -- whom Dutroux admits kidnapping.</p>
<p>The Jumet house was formerly occupied by Frenchman Bernard Weinstein, an accomplice who Dutroux admits murdering. His body was found next to those of Julie and Melissa.</p>
<p>South of Charleroi in the city of Neufchateau, the nerve centre of the investigations, chief police detective Georges Zicot appeared before magistrates on charges of vehicle theft, insurance fraud and forgery. He wore a flack-jacket.</p>
<p>He and three other men were arrested last Sunday in connection with the car theft ring uncovered by police investigating a paedophile sex gang allegedly led by Dutroux.</p>
<p>Dutroux has been linked to organised vehicle theft and police are investigating the child sex and theft ring together.</p>
<p>At the same time the Belgian cabinet in its first meeting since the summer break is to adopt tougher rules on the early release from prison of convicted sex offenders.</p>
<p>Dutroux, an unemployed electrician who owns six houses, was released 10 years early in 1992 after serving only three years of a 13-year sentence for raping five children.</p>
<p>Belgian radio said police would travel to Bratislava and Prague to search for missing Belgian children.</p>
<p>Dutroux has been named in Bratislava as a suspect in the murder of a young Slovak woman. Interpol's Slovak office has said he was also believed to have planned the kidnapping of at least one other Slovak woman.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Belgian gendarmerie's special disappearances squad said they were also likely to contact colleagues in Austria investigating what seemed to be a &quot;child-for-hire&quot; network spread across central Europe.</p>
<p>Dutroux has said Julie and Melissa, who he admits paying Weinstein and associate Michel Lelievre 40,000 francs ($1,300) to abduct in June 1995, starved to death early this year while he was in jail for car theft.</p>
<p>Belgian newspapers, citing well informed sources, reported on Friday that Dutroux' second wife Michelle Martin -- also under arrest -- had admitted that she failed to feed the children out of fear of facing them in their cell.</p>
<p>Ten people have so far been arrested including Martin who has been charged as an accomplice. Dutroux and Lelievre are charged with abduction and illegal imprisonment.</p>
