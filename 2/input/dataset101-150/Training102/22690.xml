<p>Sniffer dogs waited in the wings on Thursday as police searching for bodies in Belgium's child sex scandal focused on the cellar of a house owned by chief suspect Marc Dutroux.</p>
<p>The nation has been in shock since Dutroux led police on August 17 to the bodies of eight-year-old friends Melissa Russo and Julie Lejeune in the garden of another house he owns at Sars-La-Buissiere.</p>
<p>Lorries hauled debris from the sodden site at Jumet, one of Dutroux' six houses around the southern town of Charleroi, after torrential rain forced police to abandon outdoor excavations.</p>
<p>&quot;Because of the weather we can no longer work out in the yard -- it's like a big swimming pool,&quot; gendarmerie spokesman Jean-Marie Boudin, told reporters.</p>
<p>&quot;We are going to concentrate on cleaning up the house and cellar....The aim is to empty it completely,&quot; he added. &quot;We are still looking for bodies.&quot; The search, now in its third day, has so far been fruitless.</p>
<p>Work also continued inside a large ramshackle shed, where investigators were digging beneath a concrete floor.</p>
<p>&quot;Jumet still has not delivered up its secrets,&quot; the popular daily Vers L'Avenir said in its front page headline. &quot;The macabre searches at Jumet will continue to the finish,&quot; the Francophone paper Le Soir declared.</p>
<p>The Jumet investigation is expected to last at least another day. In all, 11 sites will be explored in the coming days.</p>
<p>Searches for bodies and clues have focused on teenagers An Marchal and Eefje Lambrecks, whom Dutroux, 39, has admitted kidnapping a year ago. Their fate remains unknown although police have expressed some hope they are still alive.</p>
<p>Dutroux's accomplice Bernard Weinstein, whom he admitted killing, was found next to Julie and Melissa. Two other girls, Laetitia Delhez, 14, and Sabine Dardenne, 12, were rescued on August 15 from a dungeon in yet another of Dutroux's houses.</p>
<p>Dutroux, a father of three, and associate Michel Lelievre have been charged with abduction and illegal imprisonment.</p>
<p>Dutroux said Julie and Melissa, who were abducted in June 1995, starved to death early this year. He denies killing them but admits paying Weinstein and Lelievre 40,000 francs ($1,300) to kidnap them.</p>
<p>They were buried a week ago in the city of Liege after what amounted to a state funeral amid outpourings of grief and anger.</p>
<p>In their investigations police have so far seized up to 400 videos -- some featuring Dutroux -- children's clothing, magazines and a gun.</p>
<p>The sordid affair has grabbed world headlines and prompted wider debate on trade in children, prostitution, paedophilia, and the role of the Internet in spreading the sickness.</p>
<p>Belgian media reported on Thursday an unemployed man had been arrested in Flanders for trying to sell 3,000 pornographic photographs via the Internet -- one third were of children.</p>
<p>Described as cold and manipulative, Dutroux was released 10 years early in 1992 for good behaviour from a 13-year sentence for multiple child rape, violence and illegal imprisonment.</p>
<p>Dutroux has also been named in Bratislava as a suspect in the murder of a young Slovak woman. The Slovak office of Interpol has said he was also believed to have planned the kidnapping of at least one other Slovak woman.</p>
<p>So far 10 people have been arrested in what has now become known as the &quot;Dutroux Affair&quot;, including Dutroux' second wife Michelle Martin, who has been charged as an accomplice.</p>
<p>There has been widespread anger over revelations of police bungling, and an inquiry is under way. A chief police detective has also been arrested on fraud charges, fuelling questions about a possible high-level cover-up.</p>
