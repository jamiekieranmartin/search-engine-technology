<p>South Africa on Tuesday dismissed Iranian reports that it had praised Tehran's human rights record following talks between the two country's presidents.</p>
<p>The foreign ministry also denied that Nelson Mandela had joined his visiting counterpart, Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, in calling at the weekend for all foreign forces to withdraw from the Gulf.</p>
<p>Pretoria said in a statement that it strongly denied Iranian media reports that the two presidents had issued a joint communique after the visit, which ended on Saturday, expressing satisfaction with human rights and democracy in Iran.</p>
<p>&quot;Despite many hours of intense negotiation on a final communique, agreement had not been reached on wording acceptable to both sides in respect of the issue of human rights in Iran,&quot; the ministry said.</p>
<p>A spokesman also denied a report on Voice of Iran state radio that Mandela joined Rafsanjani in calling for foreign forces to quit the Gulf.</p>
<p>&quot;While South African has repeated its reservations about recent unilateral American actions in Iraq, no such joint statement was made,&quot; he said. &quot;No joint communique was issued.&quot;</p>
<p>Analysts say Mandela hopes to stay friends with old allies such as Iran which backed his African National Congress in the struggle against apartheid.</p>
<p>But he also wants to keep on good terms with the United States and other Western countries that accuse Iran of sponsoring terrorism and abusing human rights.</p>
<p>Amnesty International and other human rights watchdogs have urged Iran to stop executions -- many of whose victims they say are political prisoners -- and amputations of fingers of repeated offenders convicted of theft.</p>
