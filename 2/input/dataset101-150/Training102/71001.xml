<p>A heated war of words within Belgium's law and order system over who is to blame for errors in an investigation into a child sex and kidnapping case is spreading to politics, causing tension in the ruling coalition.</p>
<p>The accusations and counter-accusations have turned the deaths of four girls while in the hands of the paedophile ring, allegedly led by convicted child rapist Marc Dutroux, into a sideshow.</p>
<p>The Gendarmerie, the federal police force, and the judiciary are close to an outright slanging match over bungling in the investigation of the case and ministers responsible for the organisations are defending their actions.</p>
<p>An inquiry into the investigation has revealed a lack of communication and coordination between investigators fighting turf wars. Belgian media have said lives might have been saved if the authorities had done their jobs better.</p>
<p>Justice Minister Stefaan De Clerck commissioned two reports on what went wrong.</p>
<p>Anne Thily, Prosecutor-General to the court in the eastern city of Liege, looked into how law enforcers handled the case of two missing girls later found to have been held by Dutroux.</p>
<p>Jacques Velu, Prosecutor-General to the Cour de Cassation -- Belgium's highest court -- investigated what public prosecutors in Charleroi, where Dutroux lived and hid his victims, did.</p>
<p>There have been allegations of high-level protection of Dutroux in Charleroi. A chief inspector of the judicial police there has been arrested in connection with the case.</p>
<p>But, surprisingly, initial reports on Velu's findings said no serious errors had been made in Charleroi.</p>
<p>By contrast, Thily pointed a finger at the Gendarmerie which, seeking to safeguard its investigation in the kidnap case, had withheld information from public prosecutors, which &quot;would have made Dutroux into more than an ordinary suspect.&quot;</p>
<p>Justice Minister De Clerck last week made that conclusion public, breaching a cabinet agreement of silence about the report. He incurred the ire of Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene, socialist Interior Affairs Minister Johan vande Lanotte -- responsible for the Gendarmerie -- and of the force itself.</p>
<p>Media commentators said De Clerck, a christian-democrat like Dehaene, had sought to protect the judiciary, a charge which gained in weight over the weekend when it emerged Velu had asked De Clerck in his report to spare Charleroi prosecutors.</p>
<p>Velu's report spoke of some mistakes, but found no evidence of a protection racket and did not call for sanctions.</p>
<p>The news outraged the public prosecutor in the southern town of Neufchateau, Michel Bourlet, who had unmasked Dutroux after he snatched two girls from the area. They were rescued from a makeshift dungeon in one of Dutroux's houses.</p>
<p>Dutroux was detained and Bourlet ordered a series of arrests of accomplices either in the kidnap case or a car theft and possibly corruption racket by Dutroux. Among those arrested is Georges Zicot, chief inspector of the Charleroi judicial police, charged with car theft, insurance fraud and forgery.</p>
<p>In a newspaper interview at the weekend Bourlet said Velu's findings were diametrically opposed to what was in his dossier.</p>
<p>The outburst reinforced the impression of a cover-up in the secretive judicial world, a charge echoed by the chairman of the largest union of Gendarmerie staff.</p>
<p>Paul Van Keer told a congress in Charleroi magistrates were in the habit of quickly classifying the files on prominent Belgians as confidential and letting them rest. &quot;If the (Velu and Thily) reports are to be an alibi to rescue the establishment, then we will open up our dossiers,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Opposition leader Herman De Croo of the Dutch-language liberals lashed out against &quot;this backmail&quot; and demanded the government stopped the &quot;dirty war&quot; among the law and order forces, fed by the party-political interests of the christian-democrats and the socialists in the coalition.</p>
