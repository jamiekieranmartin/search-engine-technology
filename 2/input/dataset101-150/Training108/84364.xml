<title>USA: Step taken toward gene therapy for a form of anemia.</title>

<p>U.S. researchers on Monday reported a step toward gene therapy for a form of anemia common in patients with kidney failure and in some AIDS patients.</p>
<p>The study is preliminary and has only been done on mice. Human trials will not start for about a year, so it is not yet known whether this will be a therapeutic breakthrough or another disappointment in the difficult field of gene therapy.</p>
<p>But Dr. Jeffrey Leiden, the head of cardiology at the University of Chicago and the lead researcher, said he had taken an approach that was easier than many gene therapy experiments, and if successful would also give patients a simpler and less expensive treatment for the anemia.</p>
<p>This form of anemia is caused by a shortage of a hormone called erythropoietin (Epo). Made in the kidneys, the hormone signals bone marrow to produce red blood cells.</p>
<p>Patients who do not have enough red blood cells develop anemia. They must get shots of the hormone two or three times a week, at a cost of about $8,000 a year.</p>
<p>Leiden's approach, described in Tuesday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, splices the gene that makes the hormone onto a small piece of &quot;naked DNA&quot; called plasmid.</p>
<p>Then the gene is injected into the mice's muscles, where it becomes in essence an erythropoietin factory, pumping the hormone into the bloodstream.</p>
<p>&quot;It's very powerful protein. You don't need to make bucketloads of it,&quot; Leiden said in an interview.</p>
<p>The &quot;naked DNA&quot; approach is simpler than the other major thrust of gene therapy research. That usually involves modifying a virus to make it harmless, inserting the desired gene, and then using the virus to ferry the gene into the targeted site in the body.</p>
<p>&quot;We like this as a model system,&quot; Leiden said. &quot;And the principles are applicable to a wide variety of diseases,&quot; including possibly other diseases caused by serum protein deficiencies such as hemophilia or diabetes.</p>
<p>Analysts believe the market for recombinant erythropoietin in 1996 will be around $1 billion. Amgen Inc, which makes it under the name Epogen, reported sales of that drug above $880 million in 1995.</p>
