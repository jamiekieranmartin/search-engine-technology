<p>By Neil Winton, Science and Technology Correspondent</p>
<p>In less than 20 years, inoperable tumours will be cured by a laser beam penetrating deep into the body and activating a cancer killing compound.</p>
<p>And perhaps sooner than this, cancers, diabetes, skin diseases, and psychiatric disorders will all be tackled successfully by an understanding of how the bodies' lipids work.</p>
<p>This is the vision of Dr David Horrobin, chief executive of pharmaceuticals firm Scotia Holdings. If this comes to pass millions of patients will be cured and his company and shareholders suitably enriched.</p>
<p>Scotia is one of many small pharmaceuticals companies seeking to break into the big league by developing new drugs.</p>
<p>These companies are kept alive by investors pumping in money in the hope that the short term gamble will pay off with big longterm gains when &quot;blockbuster&quot; drugs are discovered.</p>
<p>Scotia says it is different from most of these research based companies, many of which seek drugs from biotechnology, as it has solid revenues and profits from a range of over-the-counter pharmaceuticals and nutritional supplements.</p>
<p>But Scotia still managed to lose 9.2 million pounds ($14.31 million) in the half year ending in June 30. Sales were 7.3 million pounds ($11.35 million).</p>
<p>Horrobin, who held academic medical posts in Britain, Kenya, and Canada before heading Scotia, questions the preoccupation with biotechnology.</p>
<p>Biotechnology, where scientists manipulate living organisms to seek cures for diseases or the improvement of crops, worries the public which suspects it might cause more harm than good.</p>
<p>&quot;I think there have been too many science fiction stories of genetic manipulation and cloning. I think it will take a long time before they (the public) are really satisfied that this is a benign technology that doesn't have a potential for disaster,&quot; said Horrobin in an interview.</p>
<p>He was talking in his office overlooking one of Scotland's many scenic lochs at the company's new plant about 20 miles (32 km) west of Stornoway in the outer Hebrides, a few hundred yards (metres) from the 4,000-year-old Standing Stones of Callanish.</p>
<p>Scotia opened a 6 million pounds research and production facility there this month.</p>
<p>Treating cancers with light-activated drugs is called photodynamic therapy.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a technology which treats cancer with drugs which are inherently harmless, but which accumulate in the cancer and which can then be activated by light.</p>
<p>&quot;After concentrating in the cancer cells you have a situation where most of the drug is in the cancer cells, and very little in rest of the body.</p>
<p>&quot;If you then shine the right wavelength of light on the tissue, the light activates the drug, that makes the drug toxic and because it is in the cancer cells they die, and because it is not in the normal cells the normal cells are not affected,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Scotia is developing Foscan, a photodynamic drug, which should be available by 1998. Some cancers caught in the early stages of development will be targetted by this treatment. But it will be up to 20 years before it becomes an allround cure.</p>
<p>&quot;We are working on ultra-light sensitive drugs where the light that you could shine through a person's whole body could activate that drug.</p>
<p>&quot;So looking 15, 20 years down the line, you'd inject the drug. Two days later you'd put the patient into a light box for 10 minutes, the light would activate the drug, and the cancer cells anywhere in the body would be eliminated.</p>
<p>&quot;You could put this right into the middle of the brain, or right into the liver, or anywhere,&quot; Horrobin said.</p>
<p>The study of lipids also promises to be a successful area for new pharmaceuticals.</p>
<p>&quot;What convinces us that we are right is that if you look at the acadmemic world every decent university in the world has a research group looking at the biological actions of lipids,&quot; Horrobin added.</p>
<p>Lipids are fats which make up the cell membrane and regulate almost all cell functions. Most pharmaceutical companies' products act on proteins or genes. Scotia is almost alone in seeking cures via lipids.</p>
<p>&quot;We think that the thousand or so lipids that you find in the cell membranes are excellent targets for drug action,&quot; he continued. &quot;The existing industry really doesn't look at that at all. We think the evidence is really building up very strongly that we are right.</p>
<p>&quot;So I think the whole area of dermatology, diabetes, cancer -- all of these are where lipids are very important. And finally, and perhaps the most important of all, is psychiatry.</p>
<p>&quot;Because the brain is 60 percent by weight lipid our brains are basicically fat organs and they've got roughly 1,000 different types of lipid, each doing something different and specific, and what we are aiming to do is target drugs to particular aspects of those lipid functions.&quot;</p>
