<p>Cancer researchers on Thursday reported taking a step toward understanding the &quot;biological clock&quot; of tumour development in cancers linked to viruses.</p>
<p>Tumour formation is a gradual, multi-step process. Scientists want to learn how the biological clock ticks, and at which point the process of turning normal cells into cancerous ones become irreversible.</p>
<p>In research published in Friday's edition of the journal Science, scientists from the National Institutes of Health and the University of Maryland report on this timing mechanism in cancer caused by a virus in genetically-adapted mice.</p>
<p>Although the finding has no direct implications for cancer patients, it does have future potential for viral-related human cancers, most prominently cervical cancer linked to the human papilloma virus, said Dr. Priscilla Furth of Maryland.</p>
<p>&quot;It could illustrate that there is a biological window, if you have any oncogenic insult, there would be some window where you would be able to make an intervention,&quot; she said in an interview. Oncogenes are genes that make proteins that transform normal cells into malignancies.</p>
<p>In papilloma, some day doctors may be able to tell whether and when the virus was cleared from a woman's body. That could determine whether she was at risk for cancer, Furth said.</p>
<p>In the mice experiments, researchers used the common antibiotic tetracycline to turn off a protein, Simian Virus 40- T-antigen (Tag), that transforms healthy cells into abnormal &quot;precancerous&quot; ones.</p>
<p>When the mice were born, the Tag protein was switched on and within two weeks, cells under glands in the jaw were showing abnormalities.</p>
<p>Within four weeks, the glands were abnormal and by the end of seven months, the glandular structure was way out of kilter with cells multiplying out of control, the researchers found.</p>
<p>But another group of mice was given tetracycline after four months to stop production of Tag. After three weeks on the drug, no abnormal cells were detected.</p>
<p>But in mice given the drug after seven months, it was too late. Tag production stopped, but abnormal cells persisted.</p>
<p>&quot;We would like to know what the mechanism for the disappearance of those cells is,&quot; said Furth, referring to whether the abnormal cells die off or whether they turn into healthy normal cells once again.</p>
