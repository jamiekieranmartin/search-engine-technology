<p>The old adage that an apple a day keeps the doctor away is true, doctors reported on Friday -- people who eat fresh fruit every day have fewer heart attacks.</p>
<p>A Europe-wide study of diet and health also found that meat-eaters are more likely to be obese.</p>
<p>The study, published in the British Medical Journal, added to a growing weight of evidence that people's bodies need a steady input of fresh fruit and vegetables.</p>
<p>Britain's Imperial Cancer Research Fund (ICRF) and Medical Research Council are doing a study of 11,000 &quot;health-conscious&quot; people recruited through health-food stores, clinics and vegetarian societies.</p>
<p>Interim results published on Friday show that, over a 17-year period, there were 32 percent fewer stroke deaths among people who ate fresh fruit every day compared to those who did not. They found a 24 percent drop in heart attack deaths and a 21 percent deacrease in deaths of all kinds.</p>
<p>&quot;This study shows that if you do eat fresh fruit daily, the chances of dying from a heart attack or stroke are significantly reduced,&quot; said one of the report's authors, Dr Tim Key.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a simple message which supports the old saying &quot;an apple a day...'&quot;</p>
<p>Key added that there was also evidence fresh fruit protects against cancer and the study would be looking at this.</p>
<p>In the second half of the study, 21,000 people classified as meat-eaters, fish-eaters, vegetarians or vegans were monitored for obesity, defined as being 20 percent over ideal weight.</p>
<p>&quot;Within the group of meat-eaters 9.2 percent of women and 6.4 percent of men were clinically obese,&quot; the ICRF said in a statement. Among those who did not eat meat, including fish-eaters, 2.7 percent of men and 4.8 percent of the women were obese. Non meat-eaters were also slimmer, with vegans the slimmest. The longer the time since someone had eaten meat, the slimmer he or she was.</p>
<p>&quot;These data suggest that a meat-free diet is associated with a low prevalence of obesity,&quot; Key's group wrote.</p>
