<p>Russian President Boris Yeltsin would have been in deeper trouble if he had developed his heart trouble 25 years ago.</p>
<p>Stone Age healers were doing crude brain surgery 10,000 years ago, likewise the ancient Egyptians, but heart surgery is a modern, hi-tech operation.</p>
<p>It could not be seriously attempted until after World War Two, when drugs and technology made the heart-lung machine possible. This takes over for patients' circulation during heart surgery -- keeping them alive while the heart is cut into, manipulated or, in the case of a transplant, removed.</p>
<p>The heart bypass surgery Yeltsin is apparently about to undergo was still highly experimental in the late 1960s and has only recently become more routine than an appendectomy.</p>
<p>In the case of the Kremlin leader, the problem seems to be whether he is well enough for an operation.</p>
<p>&quot;To do heart surgery, you need to use a heart-lung machine and to do that you need to be able to anticoagulate the blood,&quot; said John Pepper of London's Royal Brompton Hospital, one of Britain's top heart surgeons.</p>
<p>Until the anticoagulant drug heparin was synthesised from a liver chemical, there was no way to keep a patient's blood artificially circulating.</p>
<p>&quot;All sorts of peculiar surgery was being done,&quot; Pepper said. Sometimes patients were packed in ice to slow their metabolisms and reduce the need for oxygen. This gave surgeons about eight minutes to do their work before they had to re-start the heart.</p>
<p>&quot;It was perfectly feasible but you could not do many things,&quot; pioneer British heart surgeon Donald Ross said.</p>
<p>It was not really until the 1950s that doctors seriously attempted heart surgery, beginning on children and babies with congenital heart problems.</p>
<p>Surgeons started repairing damaged heart valves in the early 1960s but were not able to address the problem of clogged arteries until the late 1960s.</p>
<p>Coronary artery disease is one of the biggest killers of the Western world. Fats in the blood oxidise and clog up the arteries. Yeltsin is the most prominent recent victim, but it affects millions.</p>
<p>Had Yeltsin developed his heart problems before the late 1960s, he would have simply suffered with chest pain and heart attacks until he died.</p>
<p>&quot;He would have been up a creek,&quot; Pepper said. &quot;There wouldn't have been anything to offer him.&quot;</p>
<p>In 1967 doctors at the Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland, Ohio performed the first heart bypass, using a vein to literally pass by a clogged artery to restore blood flow from the heart.</p>
<p>British doctors duplicated the operation in 1968, and advances were made very quickly. Nonetheless, it was dangerous.</p>
<p>&quot;The patient had to be pretty tough,&quot; said Pepper. &quot;The mortality was horrific and you were offered people who were desperate. The methods of investigation were very crude and a lot of things were not understood.&quot;</p>
<p>But the results were often dramatic. When in December 1967 South African surgeon Christiaan Barnard performed the first heart transplant, heart surgeons became the heroes of the age.</p>
<p>Pepper said there was still a long way to go. &quot;In the history of surgery, this has been the most investigated and studied operation ever,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>By the 1980s it was clear that an artery was better for the operation than a vein, and techniques were refined further. The death rate from the operation fell to two percent.</p>
<p>Now, coronary bypass surgery is one of the most frequently performed operations. &quot;In the U.S. a coronary operation is more common than an appendectomy,&quot; Pepper said. &quot;I do 250 to 300 a year.&quot;</p>
<p>Doctors are experimenting with more advanced technuques, the latest being minimally invasive surgery, done with an endoscope -- a tiny camera attached to a cable that allows surgeons to operate without cracking open the chest.</p>
<p>Some of the techniques even allow surgery without the use of the heart-lung machine.</p>
