<p>More than one million prescriptions for Interneuron Pharmaceuticals Inc's new Redux drug to treat obesity have been written in the first three months since the drug was approved, president and chief executive Glenn Cooper said Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;More than 80,000 doctors have written prescriptions for Redux, and we expected to see continued growth,&quot; Cooper told the Montgomery Securities Investment conference here.</p>
<p>Cooper also said he saw a &quot;fairly minimal&quot; market impact from new studies showing that Redux and other appetite suppressants carried a higher risk of pulmonary hypertension than originally believed.</p>
<p>&quot;But (the findings) are serving to keep the drug focused as a treatment for severe obesity and away from the cosmetic market, where it should not be,&quot; Cooper added.</p>
<p>Cooper also told the investment conference that he saw a potential new drug application (NDA) for its Citicoline treatment for acute stroke by 1997; and another NDA for its Pagoclone treatment for anxiety and panic disorder in 1988 or 1999.  </p>
<p>Cooper added that Interneuron believes its Citicoline stroke drug could be &quot;a fast track approval candidate,&quot; if its ongoing Phase Three trials are successful.</p>
<p>He said that while Genentech earlier this year became the first company to introduce a drug for stroke victims, that drug, Activase, can only be used to treat patients who get to a hospital within three hours of the attack. He said the race to develop a drug that could be more broadly applied was &quot;highly competitive.&quot;</p>
<p>Interneuron said stroke patients can be treated with Citicoline for up to 24 hours after an attack.</p>
<p>Cooper added that projections for a 1998 or 1999 NDA for its Pagoclone anti-anxiety drug was based on its plans to start a pivitol trials of the drug before the end of this year.</p>
