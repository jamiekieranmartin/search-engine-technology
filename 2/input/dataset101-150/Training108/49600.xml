<p>In the latest glimpse into the basic biology of hunger, scientists have learned that a brain hormone identified less than a year ago can suppress the appetite without causing stress or similar side effects.</p>
<p>The research, by scientists at the Salk Institute of Biological Studies and the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California, will appear on Friday in the journal Science.</p>
<p>The experiments on the hormone, called urocortin, were performed on rats. Much more research needs to be done before scientists know whether the discovery can be harnessed to help control human obesity or treat eating disorders like anorexia.</p>
<p>Urocortin, discovered by Salk scientists last November, appears related to another hormone, corticotropin releasing factor, or CRF, which plays a role in stress and in the relationship between stress and appetite loss.</p>
<p>But according to the new rat research, urocortin has a stronger effect on hunger and appetitite than CRF does, without the stress factor.</p>
<p>In one experiment, lab rats were not fed for 24 hours. Then one group of rats was injected with urocortin. A control group was not. The rats that had the injection ate much less than those that did not receive the hormone. And the bigger the dose of urocortin the bigger the drop in food consumption.</p>
<p>The effect of the hormone was also studied on rats that were not deprived of food all day.</p>
<p>Those that had the injection of the hormone ate the same number of meals as those that did not get the treatment. But their meals were smaller.</p>
<p>That result is similar to the pattern seen in humans taking the new drug Redux.</p>
<p>Unlike CRF, urocortin did not induce stress or anxiety in animals, suggesting that there is at least a possibility that drugs could be developed to mimic or raise the hormone levels without these side effects.</p>
