<p>Air travellers in the former Soviet Union get used to the ripped carpets and broken seats and try to tell themselves that vital bits of the ageing Tupolev, Ilyushin and Yakovlev airliners must be in better condition.</p>
<p>The crash of a Tupolev Tu-154M, the workhorse of the old Soviet fleet, on Spitzbergen on Thursday was a reminder that, in some cases at least, it might just be wishful thinking. It was the second Russian Tu-154 to crash in less than a year.</p>
<p>Norwegian officials on the Arctic island said all 143 people on board, mainly Ukrainian coalminers as well as some of their wives and children, were killed when the three-engined plane came down as it attempted to land in bad weather.</p>
<p>Military aviation officials familiar with the harsh flying conditions in the far north told Itar-Tass news agency a snow flurry could have blinded the pilot -- a major problem when landing at Arctic airfields with minimal navigational aids.</p>
<p>The charter plane was operated by Moscow-based Vnukovo Airlines, one of the bigger private operators among hundreds of so-called &quot;babyflots&quot; spawned when Soviet-era Aeroflot broke up.</p>
<p>Vnukovo Airlines, which had been flying the plane for eight years, said the crew was one of its most experienced.</p>
<p>The splitting up of the state monolith into hundreds of small firms, many of them with little cash, has raised concerns about air safety since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.</p>
<p>The Russian Transport Ministry suspended flights by as many as 90 of the 420 airlines operating in Russia last year when 245 people died in 18 crashes, a slight improvement on 1994 when 327 people were killed in 20 accidents.</p>
<p>After 70 people died in March 1994 when an Aeroflot pilot allowed his teenage son to send an Airbus A310 crashing into the Siberian taiga, the International Airline Passengers Association warned its members not to fly over the former Soviet Union.</p>
<p>The Transport Ministry conceded in April 1995 that air safety had become &quot;very weak&quot; and ordered new controls.</p>
<p>But the U.S. Federal Aviation Authority said in December after the crash of a 20-year-old Khabarovsk Airlines Tu-154 in the far east that Russian airlines were &quot;minimally meeting requirements&quot; of the International Civil Aviation Organisation.</p>
<p>A series of crashes of cargo aircraft, though usually less costly in lives, have also served as reminders of problems.</p>
<p>Just last week, all 12 people on board were killed when a Russian-owned Ilyushin Il-76 freighter crashed at Belgrade airport.</p>
<p>Fourteen died in April when an Il-76 came down on the Kamchatka peninsula. Neither the crew nor the air traffic controllers seemed aware the plane was off course and the controllers' directions sent the aircraft into a mountain.</p>
<p>Two Russian pilots were jailed in Zaire this month. Their overloaded Antonov An-32 had belly-flopped on takeoff in January, killing over 300 people in a Kinshasa marketplace.</p>
<p>Russian planemakers, heirs to one of the jewels in the crown of Soviet industry, defend their craft but complain that lack of cash has meant poor maintenance.</p>
<p>Pilots unions' point out that Russian aircrews, mostly former Soviet air force personnel, must fly in worse weather and with many fewer electronic aids than colleagues in the west.</p>
<p>Whatever the verdict, the inhabitants of the world's biggest territory have no choice but to keep on flying if they are to travel around their own country.</p>
