<p>A task force appointed to review the FAA's work after a ValuJet Inc. crash in May was calling for tighter regulation of new airlines and tougher oversight of aircraft maintenance, the CNBC cable network reported on Tuesday.</p>
<p>CNBC said it obtained an advance copy of the report by the task force, headed by Federal Aviation Administration Deputy Administrator Linda Hall Daschel.</p>
<p>The report calls for the FAA to make it much tougher for start-up airlines to get into the air, in part by creating an FAA national certification group that would work with local flight safety offices in granting approval, CNBC said.</p>
<p>It quoted one panel member as saying the FAA had in recent years become &quot;a hand-holder for start-ups.&quot;</p>
<p>The FAA came under sharp scrutiny after the ValuJet crash in May, which killed all 110 people aboard. Lawmakers, flight attendants and passengers' groups complained that the agency was not doing enough to oversee young airlines.</p>
<p>The panel's report also wants to limit the number of carriers assigned to a single geographic inspector, as well as creating a model contract for outsourcing of maintenance work.</p>
<p>ValuJet, for instance, had used dozens of different maintenance shops, while Southwest Airlines, another young airline, outsources all its maintenance work, but to only one facility.</p>
<p>The panel also recommended that the FAA get rid of contradictions in its handbooks, hire more inspectors, and stop assigning the most experienced -- and best paid -- inspectors to the well-established airlines, while leaving less experienced inspectors in charge of newer carriers.</p>
<p>No comment was immediately available from the FAA.</p>
