<p>Rich International Airways, grounded by the Federal Aviation Administration last week, has developed a plan to address the FAA's safety concerns and get back into the air, a company spokesman said.</p>
<p>&quot;The FAA has named a team of inspectors to work with us,&quot; said spokesman Mike Clark, and &quot;we are busily working away to take care of their concerns.&quot; He declined to estimate when Rich might be flying again.</p>
<p>The Miami-based all-charter airline was grounded by the air safety agency on September 2 due to safety concerns. The privately held airline carries little cargo, but its 21 planes stranded about 15,000 people in mid-vacation.</p>
<p>Rich worked with tour operators and other airlines to get all the passengers home, Clark said.</p>
<p>Rich has had safety problems before. It was grounded in 1984 and in April the FAA proposed a $2.6 million fine on Rich, which the airline is contesting.  Clark said in 27 years of operation, the airline has never had a death or injury.</p>
