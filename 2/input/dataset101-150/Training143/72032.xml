<p>A worldwide network to share information on air safety should be set up to swap and disseminate the wealth of data that already exists to make flying safer, a top industry official urged here Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;We're going to have to find ways to close the door, leave the badges behind and share information about what causes aviation accidents,&quot; Edmond Soliday, vice president of corporate safety and security for UAL Corp's United Airlines told the Americas Conference on Aviation.</p>
<p>If accident rates don't improve worldwide, the Boeing Co has projected that by the year 2015 with increased air traffic there will be a fatal air accident every eight to ten days, officials at the conference noted.</p>
<p>&quot;We must find new ways to share information that are faster, more accurate, more comprehensive, more organized and more secure,&quot; Soliday said.</p>
<p>One barrier to such cooperation is that many entities do not trust one another to share information, he said. Carriers do not trust their competitors or unions and nobody trusts the government, he said.</p>
<p>Another speaker at the meeting of airline industry and public officials from throughout North and South America, Barry Bermingham, deputy assistant administrator for the Federal Aviation Administration, told of potentially dangerous quirks at some airports that &quot;all the pilots knew about&quot; and compensate for, but are not discussed. Eventually some of these problems have caused accidents, Bermingham said.</p>
<p>Soliday urged the creation of some type of flight safety round table which would have no ties to any organization, manufacturer, airline or government. &quot;The key ingredient to our success is trust,&quot; Soliday said.</p>
<p>The Federal Aviation Administration is pushing a similar proposal it calls a Global Analysis and Information Network or GAIN.</p>
<p>&quot;GAIN would make (safety information) available online to aviation safety researchers everywhere,&quot; said David Hinson, FAA administrator.</p>
<p>&quot;GAIN has a lot of positive things going for it,&quot; Soliday told Reuters, but &quot;it rests on the expectation that people will freely give information. I think you have got to build trust before you build systems. You have got to bring people together first.&quot;</p>
<p>Under Soliday's round table plan, information would be shared orally and &quot;all information would remain the property of the participants. No raw data would be given up.&quot;</p>
<p>But besides the roundtable idea, Soliday urged aviation participants to trust each other more and swap information informally.</p>
<p>&quot;We (United) have shared our emergency response manual with at least 60 carriers,&quot; he said.</p>
