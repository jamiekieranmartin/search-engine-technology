<p>Rich International Airways, grounded by the Federal Aviation Administration Monday due to safety concerns, said it would meet with the FAA on Tuesday to try to set a plan to return to the air as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Rich's suspension, the second for the airline, was announced Monday night after the FAA discovered &quot;a series of discrepancies&quot; in Rich's training and maintenance records.</p>
<p>Privately-held Rich, primarily a charter airline which carries only limited cargo, is based in Miami and fields 21 aircraft.</p>
<p>Rich &quot;was totally surprised by the FAA's action,&quot; William Meenan, the carrier's president said through a spokesman.</p>
<p>&quot;We have lost confidence in Rich International,&quot; Bill White, the FAA's deputy director of Flight Standards Service told reporters in a Monday night phone briefing.</p>
<p>In April, the FAA also proposed a $2.6 million file against Rich for improper maintenance. According to the FAA, Rich used parts from aircraft that had been used outside the United States, without properly checking the history of the parts.</p>
<p>Rich is contesting the fine.</p>
<p>Rich was grounded by the FAA in April 1984 for safety concerns.</p>
<p>Rich said it is trying to arrange service with other airlines for stranded passengers.</p>
<p>Rich also said that in 27 years of operations it has never had an injury or fatality.</p>
