<p>Mesa Air Group has signed an agreement with the Federal Aviation Administration to pay a $500,000 fine for maintenance problems and to further improve flight safety, the FAA said Wednesday.</p>
<p>It said $250,000 of the fine would be waived if the new safety steps were implemented according to the approved plan.</p>
<p>The fine and stipulated further safety steps were announced by Mesa last week.</p>
<p>Mesa, with more than 150 planes, is a major operator of commuter services under such names as United Express, USAir Express and America West Express, as well as Mesa Airlines.</p>
<p>The FAA cited violations by Mesa that included allowing engines to be started without a fire guard on hand, allowing passengers to walk near an aircraft with its engines running, improperly repairing fuel leaks and improperly installing screws on a propeller blade.</p>
<p>The FAA also said Mesa was using outdated flight manuals.</p>
<p>It said Mesa disputed some of the agency's findings.</p>
<p>FAA officials said an inspection of Mesa began last year and another was continuing now to assure it complied with the new safety standards that commuters must meet by next March to bring their safety level up to that of the big carriers.</p>
<p>The officials said that if Mesa failed to meet the deadlines it would be fined $5,000 for each missed deadline.</p>
<p>In a statement, the FAA said both it and Mesa also realised that because of the carrier's future expansion plans, operational changes were needed to cope with the additional planes and routes.</p>
<p>The FAA conceded after the crash of ValuJet flight 592 near Miami May 11, killing all 110 on board, that closer scrutiny had to be given to young, fast-growing airlines.</p>
<p>After an inspection, ValuJet was grounded. The agency cited maintenance problems in handling its fast-growing fleet.</p>
<p>FAA officials said that all of Mesa's shortcomings were corrected by the time FAA officials began their inspections or by the time the inspections were completed.</p>
<p>Thomas Stuckey, flight standards manager in the FAA's Dallas-Fort Worth office, said when inspectors went in they found some unsafe conditions in aircraft not in service as well as failures to comply with FAA approved company manual.</p>
<p>He said the $500,000 fine was leveled because of these violations, but &quot;the carrier today is in compliance.&quot;</p>
<p>He said the new standards Mesa must meet included hiring a full time director of training and more training instructors, using more flight simulators and starting an internal audit and evaluation programme.</p>
