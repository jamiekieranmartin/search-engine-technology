<headline>FAA task force advises close check on new carriers.</headline>

<p>A task force appointed by the Federal Aviation Administration recommended Wednesday closer scrutiny of new air carriers in the wake of the ValuJet Inc  crash in May.</p>
<p>The task force, headed by deputy FAA administrator Linda Daschle, recommended creating an FAA national certification team to assist local flight safety offices in granting approval to the new carriers.</p>
<p>It also recommended that the FAA hire more safety inspectors and toughen oversight of aircraft maintentance.  </p>
<p>FAA Adminstrator David Hinson sent the report to Vice President Al Gore with a cover letter saying it included the &quot;lessons learned&quot; from FAA's oversight experience with ValuJet following the May 11 crash in the Florida Everglades which killed 110 people.</p>
<p>&quot;I endorse the recommendations,&quot; Hinson wrote, &quot;and have asked that the agency develop a strategy and timetable for implmenting these actions in the short- and mid-term range.&quot;  </p>
<p>The FAA came under sharp scrutiny after the ValuJet crash. Lawmakers, flight attendants and passengers' groups complained the agency was not doing enough to oversee young airlines.</p>
<p>The task force said the FAA should make surveillance of air carriers more systematic -- such as by requiring comprehensive annual surveillance plans for each air carrier.</p>
<p>It said the FAA had to be sure newly-certified air carriers have adequate resources and infrastructure to support stable and safe operations and growth. This could be done by heightening the level of surveillance for at least the first five years of a company's operation.</p>
<p>The task force report said many air carriers are making greater use of &quot;outsourcing&quot; as a means to trim costs and remain competitive. It said the industry should be encouraged to develop a model contract for outsourcing maintenance work.</p>
<p>ValuJet had used dozens of different maintenance shops, while Southwest Airlines, another young airline, outsources all its maintenance work, but to only one facility.</p>
<p>The report said an additional 146 safety inspectors and 74 support staff should be hired over current plans for the next fiscal year, beginning Oct. 1. Another 135 inspectors and 53 support personnel should be added the following year, it said.</p>
