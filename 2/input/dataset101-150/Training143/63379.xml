<headline>Mesa Air fined, to make safety changes.</headline>
<dateline>FARMINGTON, N.M. 1996-09-19</dateline>
<text>
<p>Mesa Air Group Inc has agreed to make substantial organizational changes to address Federal Aviation Administration safety concerns, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Larry Risley said.</p>
<p>The carrier, based here, was also fined $500,000 &quot;as a result of past inspection findings,&quot; Risley rold Reuters in a telephone interview.</p>
<p>&quot;The agreement (with the FAA) is intended to ensure the carrier meets or exceeds regulatory requirements during its planned growth and expansion,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>&quot;We have agreeed to improve methods to verify that all our aircraft meet airworthy regulations,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Of the fine, Risley said, &quot;We'll pay $250,000 up front and the other $250,000 will be waived -- not forgiven, but waived. And when Mesa has complied with all the parts of the agreement, that remaining $250,000 will be forgiven.&quot;</p>
<p>He said the FAA would announce details of the agreement in Washington later today or on Friday.</p>
<p>Mesa Air Group operates under the names Mesa Airlines, America West Express, United Express and USAir Express. Its fleet has more than doubled to 175 planes in five years.  </p>
<p>It came under FAA investigation last year and several maintenance problems were found. They were reportedly similar to those found with ValuJet Airlines after one of its planes crashed in the Everglades on May 11, killing 110 people.</p>
<p>But Risely said the FAA found no safety dangers in Mesa's air services.</p>
<p>&quot;There is not a concern with the safety of the airline relative to the existing day-to-day operations. The concern that the FAA has expressed is our ability to maintain that level of safety going forward as we continue to grow the airline,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Risley said the &quot;substantial&quot; organizational changes in the agreement with the FAA include increasing the numbers of flight maintenance and ground personnel, opening a single maintenance control center and implementing new training and internal audit programs.</p>
<p>Some of the changes are already under way and all will be carried through within 12 months. &quot;There will be additional costs associated with some of restructuring processes but it will primarily be personnel costs and we have not at this time measured that in dollars...We don't believe it is going to have a real impact on the cost of the business,&quot; Risley said.</p>
<p>Mesa Air Group operates 115 19-passenger planes, five 37-passenger turbo-props and 32 30-passenger turbo-props as well as two Fokker 70 jets, which each carry 78 passengers.</p>
<p>It also ordered 16 50-passenger regional jets and is waiting for their delivery. They will be used for the launch of Mesa's jet service at Meacham Airport in Fort Worth, Texas next May.</p>
