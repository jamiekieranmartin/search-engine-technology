<p>Florida executive branch chiefs will ask the Legislature to outlaw gambling cruises rather than bar casino ships from docking in state-owned marinas, Tampa Tribune reported Wednesday.</p>
<p>Casino gambling is illegal in Florida but boats take thousands of passengers from Florida docks every day to gamble in international waters where state laws do not apply.</p>
<p>As trustee of state lands, Attoney General Bob Butterworth asked Florida Cabinet members Tuesday to consider ending leases with nearly a dozen gambling ships that dock in state-owned marinas.</p>
<p>Secretary of State Sandra Mortham said that would give an unfair competitive advantage to private ports and docks, which could continue mooring casino ships.</p>
<p>She agreed with Ralph Haben, lobbyist for Florida Day Cruise Association, who said that if the state wants to bar the cruises it should do so by legislation and not by denying leases.</p>
<p>Mortham moved to send the issue back to the Legislature and the other Cabinet members agreed.</p>
<p>The Cabinet, made up of the governor, comptroller, attorney general and other executive branch leaders, passed a resolution in March decrying the expansion of casino ships in Florida waters. They asked the Legislature to take up the issue in its spring session but lawmakers declined.</p>
