<p>Chilean Finance Minister Eduardo Aninat said Monday he still sees political support in the United States for free trade and treaties like the NAFTA.</p>
<p>&quot;Personally, I have the impression and the conviction that both the Republican and the Democratic parties believe in free trade and in scrapping restrictions,&quot; said Aninat, who hopes Chile will eventually join the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).  </p>
<p>&quot;We've also seen how the United States acted at the World Trade Organization and in the Uruguay Round of GATT,&quot; added Aninat, who is chairing the IMF-World Bank annual meeting. &quot;What's important is to avoid a return to protectionism.&quot;</p>
<p>The NAFTA's original partners, Canada, Mexico and the United States, invited Chile in December, 1994 to open talks on its entry.</p>
<p>Those talks, however, stalled last year because the United States did not approve a key &quot;fast-track&quot; authority to ensure a smooth negotiation process.  </p>
<p>Although free trade is championed by most U.S. political leaders, popular support faded after the 1995 Mexican peso crisis. The Republican-controlled Congress and President Bill Clinton, a Democrat who expects to win a second term in November, did not produce a &quot;fast-track&quot; bill in this election year, and officials have made no promises for 1997.</p>
<p>Aninat said Chile was cautiously waiting for the dust to settle after the U.S. elections.</p>
<p>&quot;We are ready to do whatever is necessary to have an adequate negotiation, but what has happend was beyond our control,&quot; he said. &quot;You need two partners for this dance, and only one was ready&quot;.</p>
