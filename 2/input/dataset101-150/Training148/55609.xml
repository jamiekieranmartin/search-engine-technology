<p>Finance Minister Eduardo Aninat signalled that the economic targets contained in Chile's 1997 budget will be similar to those set this month by the Central Bank.</p>
<p>Aninat, in a published interview, said the Central Bank and the Finance Ministry had agreed on basic outlines for the 1997 targets which both institutions present to Congress.</p>
<p>The Central Bank this month forecast 5.5 percent inflation and 5.5-to-6.0 percent growth in the gross domestic product next year, both down from expected 6.5 percent inflation and seven percent GDP growth this year.  </p>
<p>Aninat will give his own targets in early October.</p>
<p>&quot;We agree fully with those targets, and when I make the Public Finances presentation in the first week of October, I will add precision to those and other goals,&quot; said Aninat in an interview in the financial daily El Diario.</p>
<p>&quot;There was a very fluid process of weekly communications (between the bank and the ministry) to agree on a common and equal diagnosis in terms of the 1997 scenario,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Aninat also said Chile and Canada were about four weeks away from finishing talks for a free trade agreement.  </p>
<p>&quot;We're about to reach, in the next four weeks I hope, an agreement with Canada,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Officials of both nations said recently they were confident they could sign a free trade pact, similar to that between Chile and Mexico, by the end of the year.</p>
<p>But Chile's long-standing wish to join the North American Free Trade Agreement has been sidetracked by the U.S. elections, said Aninat.</p>
<p>&quot;It takes two to tango, and one of those partners is now busy with another task: the elections,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Both President Bill Clinton and his predecessor George Bush have invited Chile to join NAFTA, but U.S. domestic politics have prevented full-scale negotiations from getting underway.</p>
<p>Aninat said Chileans need not forget about NAFTA, but added that Chile's entrance into it has not gone &quot;at the speed that the government wanted.&quot;</p>
