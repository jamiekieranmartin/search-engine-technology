<p>Chilean Finance Minister Eduardo Aninat, whose country hopes to join the North American Free Trade Agreement, said on Monday he still sees political support in the United States for free trade and NAFTA.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm conviced that both the Republican and the Democratic parties believe in free trade and in scrapping restrictions,&quot; Aninat, who is chairing the IMF/World Bank annual meeting, told reporters.</p>
<p>&quot;What's important is to avoid a return to protectionism.&quot;</p>
<p>NAFTA partners Canada, Mexico and the United States invited Chile in December, 1994 to open talks on joining the North American trading bloc. But those talks stalled last year because the United States did not approve a key &quot;fast-track&quot; authority to ensure a smooth negotiation process.</p>
<p>While free trade is backed by most U.S. political leaders, popular support faded after the Mexican peso crisis last year.</p>
<p>The Republican-led Congress and President Bill Clinton, a Democrat seeking a second term in November, did not draw up a &quot;fast-track&quot; bill in this election year, and officials are not promising Chile anything for 1997.</p>
<p>Aninat said Chile was cautiously waiting for the dust to settle after the U.S. elections on November 5.</p>
<p>&quot;Chile is prepared to do whatever is needed to have an adequate negotiation, but what has happened is beyond our control,&quot; he said. &quot;It takes two to tango and only one party was ready for this dance.&quot;</p>
