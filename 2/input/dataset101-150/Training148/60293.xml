<p>Agricultural trade between the three members of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) will reach $30 billion by 2005, up from $19 billion in 1995, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said Wednesday.</p>
<p>The department gave the projection in its NAFTA Situation and Outlook summary.</p>
<p>The summary said that, based on trade data for the first six months, the United States will enjoy a large agricultural trade surplus with Mexico in 1996, because of Mexico's drought and the continuing effect of its financial crisis.</p>
<p>The United States' small surplus in farm trade with Canada may disappear this year, the report added.</p>
<p>It also said regional markets are emerging within NAFTA for fruits and vegetables, animals and livestock products, and grains and feeds, as producers take advantage of production complementarities and seasonal variations that reach beyond national boundaries.</p>
