<p>Poland's oil industry holding group Nafta Polska, created to supervise the state-owned sector, is likely to launch its first privatisations next year, Nafta's deputy president said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;A memorandum with information to investors will be ready within the next three months and intensive negotiations with those interested should then last six months,&quot; Sergiusz Najar told Reuters in an interview.</p>
<p>He said Nafta management wanted to clamp Poland's five refineries in two groups, each led by one of the two biggest refineries, based in the cities of Plock and Gdansk, and initially to offer between 20 and 30 percent of shares in the groups.</p>
<p>Under the government scheme, investors buying the stakes would also gain access to the lucrative retail network of state-owned gasoline distributor CPN SA, which is to join Nafta by the end of 1996.</p>
<p>The investors would later be able to extend their stakes and Nafta itself would eventually be privatised.</p>
<p>Nafta was created in May to strengthen the oil sector ahead of the opening of Poland's fuels market to outside competition, due in the next few years.</p>
<p>Najar said Nafta would like to take a direct stake in the CPN, rather than indirectly through refineries, as the government earlier planned.</p>
<p>The government, which last week allocated 75-percent stakes in refineries to Nafta, wanted to give 50 percent of CPN shares to refineries and 25 percent to the holding.</p>
<p>But Najar said Nafta should get the full 75-percent stake in CPN to have flexibility in negotiations with investors.</p>
<p>Nafta should also take control over CPN's wholesale facilities, managed by the PERN and Naftobazy firms, which were to be carved out of the distribution company and supervised directly by the government, he said.</p>
<p>He also said Nafta would ask the government to let it have more say in managing its shares. All Nafta's strategic decisions now have to be approved by the government.</p>
