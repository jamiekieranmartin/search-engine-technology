<p>Poland's state-owned oil industry holding group  Nafta Polska SA, created to supervise sell-offs in the sector, will unveil its privatisation plan details late this year or early in 1997, Nafta official said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;A memorandum to potential investors will be ready at the turn of the year,&quot; Marek Grabarek, a management director in Nafta, told Reuters.</p>
<p>Grabarek said Nafta would begin the sector privatisation with sales of between 20 and 30 percent of shares in Plock and Gdansk refineries, Poland's two biggest such facilities.</p>
<p>The remaining five small refineries will be free to choose whether to merge with two large ones before they are sold or seek investors individually, he added.</p>
<p>Nafta Polska was created by the government in May to consolidate and strengthen the oil sector ahead of the opening of Poland's fuels market to outside competition, due in the next few years.</p>
<p>Under the government scheme, shares in the refineries and in Poland's largest fuels distributor, state-owned CPN SA, are to be allocated to Nafta this year.</p>
<p>The programme provides for selling the refineries' and CPN's shares in a package, so that an investor which decides to modernise any of the cash-needy refineries gets access to the fuels distributor's chain of nearly 1,400 petrol stations.</p>
<p>Buyers are to be initially offered minority stakes, with an option to extend them after fulfilling investment promises.</p>
<p>CPN recently said it was preparing its own privatisation programme in case the government one fails to be implemented because investors decline to buy refineries and the fuels distributor jointly. -- Robert Bogdanski +48 22 653 9700</p>
