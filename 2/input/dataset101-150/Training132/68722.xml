<p>Two more North Korean infiltrators were killed on Sunday during a gun battle with South Korean security forces, the Defence Ministry said.</p>
<p>A ministry spokesman said a South Korean soldier also died in the gun battle. Further details were not given.  </p>
<p>Another South Korean soldier was injured in the shootout, the spokesman said.</p>
<p>The latest North Korean infiltrators to be killed were among the remnants of around 26 agents who landed by submarine on Wednesday on a beach near the east coast city of Kangnung.</p>
<p>The killings brought to 20 the number of North Korean agents shot and killed in the infiltration incident. One other has been captured alive.</p>
<p>The death of the South Korean soldier was a second in two days. A paratrooper was shot and killed on Saturday during a helicopter chase for the North Korean agents across rugged mountains near Kangnung.</p>
