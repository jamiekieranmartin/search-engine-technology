<title>UNITED NATIONS: North, South Korea trade charges, threats at U.N..</title>
<headline>North, South Korea trade charges, threats at U.N..</headline>

<p>By Nicholas Doughty, Diplomatic Correspondent</p>
<p>South Korea said on Friday communist North Korea could be planning more commando-style infiltration raids following last week's crisis over a submarine from the North that foundered off the coast.</p>
<p>But North Korea, in a war of words that flared at the U.N. General Assembly, warned that its patience was running out and that it reserved the right to retaliate if the submarine was not returned soon, as it has demanded.</p>
<p>Earlier on Friday, Pyongyang warned in an official statement that it would exercise its &quot;right to retaliate&quot; if South Korea failed to return the submarine with its surviving and dead crew members who landed in the South last week.</p>
<p>They were Pyongyang's sharpest comments yet on the intrusion of the submarine that put ashore an estimated 26 armed North Koreans. Seoul says it was a commando operation, possibly intended to blow up key installations, but North Korea says it was a routine training mission that went wrong.</p>
<p>North Korea's U.N. ambassador repeated that tough line in comments to the assembly on Friday in response to a speech from South Korean Foreign Minister Ro-Myung Gong.</p>
<p>But Ambassador Park Soo Gil also added an ominous warning.</p>
<p>&quot;We cannot remain a victim for an indefinite period ... Time is not unlimited,&quot; he told the assembly.</p>
<p>South Korean security forces have killed nine of those who came ashore from the submarine, 11 were found dead -- apparently shot by their own colleagues -- one was captured alive, and five others are still believed to be on the loose.</p>
<p>South Korea's Gong, in his speech, repeated an appeal to to North Korea to join talks that would end the state of armed truce on the Korean peninsula and establish real peace.</p>
<p>Gong denounced what he called a &quot;brazen act of military provocation&quot; that he said showed Pyongyang &quot;seeks Korean unification by any means including use of force&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;The investigation is still underway to find out the purpose of the infiltration ... but the findings to date present a strong possibility that last week's infiltration is part of a larger scale infiltration operation,&quot; Gong said.</p>
<p>He urged North Korea to accept proposals for four-party peace talks involving the two Koreas, the United States and China. An armistice agreement has remained in force on the peninsula since the 1950-53 Korean war.</p>
<p>&quot;In the absence of Pyongyang's positive response and given this serious incident ... my country firmly believes that the armistice agreement should remain in full force,&quot; he said.</p>
