<p>South Korean President Kim Young-sam is considering policy changes toward North Korea after a Northern submarine dropped heavily-armed agents on a Southern beach, Seoul media said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm seriously considering reviewing our policy toward North Korea,&quot; leading newspaper Dong-A Ilbo quoted Kim as telling a group of Japanese political editors.</p>
<p>Presidential spokesmen were not available to comment.</p>
<p>In its Wednesday's edition, Dong-A said Kim did not go into details of what kind of steps the government would take, but said Kim gave a clear indication of a wide-ranging shift in the government's position toward the communist North.</p>
<p>An estimated 26 North Korean agents came ashore on an east coast beach near the city of Kangnung last Wednesday. Nine have been killed by South Korean security forces, 11 were found shot dead -- possibliy murdered by their own colleagues -- one was captured and five are thought to be still on the run.</p>
<p>Kim denounced the infiltration as an act of &quot;military provocation&quot;, saying it was not a simple spy case.</p>
<p>After asking the Japanese reporters what would happen if a submarine sneaked into Osaka or an area near Washington, Kim was quoted as saying: &quot;The United States and Japan would have probably started a war against the aggressor. The country should have disappeared as the United States would have launched an attack.&quot;</p>
<p>Breaking a week-long silence, the North on Monday demanded the return of the vessel and crew as the submarine stranded off South Korea last week due to engine failure.</p>
<p>But Kim flatly dismissed the North Korean claim as a lie, citing the fact that North Korean agents wore South Korean clothes and shoes.</p>
<p>He added that the North Korean submarine could not drift to the South due to the North-bound ocean current in the East Sea.</p>
<p>&quot;The intrusion was made deliberately from the begining,&quot; Dong-Ah quoted Kim as saying.</p>
<p>In an angry response to an incursion by the North Korean submarine, South Korea's Defence Ministry said on Tuesday that Seoul would seek to restart war games with the United States.</p>
<p>The annual Team Spirit military exercises were dropped last year as part of a landmark deal between the United States and North Korea under which Pyongyang agreed to scrap its suspected nucelar weapons programme.</p>
