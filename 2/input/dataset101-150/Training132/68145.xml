<p>A massive search for North Korean infiltrators who landed by submarine in South Korea moved to an area of mine shafts on Friday where fierce gunbattles raged through the night.</p>
<p>So far, 18 infiltrators out of about 20 who landed on Wednesday have been shot and killed -- 11 in an apparent mass suicide. One has been captured alive.</p>
<p>State television reported one infiltrator had signalled surrender on Friday by waving white clothes, but other news reports quoted military authorities denying this.</p>
<p>An army officer in the east coast city of Kangnung said there may be two or three North Koreans holed up around an area of disused coal mines in rugged mountains.</p>
<p>He said security forces had found hollows in the ground where several agents may have spent the night.</p>
<p>&quot;I heard gunfire all night and grenades exploding,&quot; said local resident Chang Choon-taik.</p>
<p>Five or six helicopters were flying over the area, which is saturated with armed troops and located about 17 km (10 miles) from the beach where the infiltrators landed.</p>
<p>South Korean authorities have described the most serious infiltration since the 1960s as a military provocation. North and South Korea have been technically at war since the 1950-53 Korean conflict ended in a truce.</p>
<p>Thousands of troops and police have been combing through undergrowth and tall grass to try to flush out the last of the North Koreans.</p>
<p>On Thursday troops shot dead seven agents and displayed their bullet-riddled bodies dressed in South Korean-made blue jeans and sneakers.</p>
<p>In Washington, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher urged &quot;all parties&quot; to avoid further provocative action. The United States has 37,000 troops stationed in the South.</p>
<p>&quot;We wish that all parties would refrain from taking further provocative actions,&quot; Christopher told a news conference.</p>
<p>Asked if the incident could affect efforts to provide Pyongyang with nuclear technology and humanitarian aid, he added: &quot;Obviously the episode is a matter of concern but the facts are so murky.&quot;</p>
<p>He said it was impossible to assess the long-term impact of the incident.</p>
<p>North Korea is on the brink of famine following devastating floods and has appealed for international aid.</p>
<p>The United States is part of an international consortium providing the North with nuclear power plants as part of a deal to end the country's suspected nuclear weapons programme.</p>
<p>In South Korea, the public has reacted with anger and anxiety to the infiltration. Some blame the navy for failing to detect the 34 metre (111 feet) submarine and worry the country is vulnerable to attack from its arch-enemy to the north.</p>
<p>Political analysts said the incident may have damaged the chances of peace on the Korean peninsula by giving ammunition to hardliners in Seoul, who oppose any concessions to the North.</p>
<p>South Korea and the United States are trying to entice Pyongyang to talks, along with China, to work out a peace pact to replace an armistice that sealed the division of the Korean peninsula in 1953.</p>
<p>South Korean President Kim Young-sam is under increasing pressure from the rightwing of his ruling New Korea Party to take a tough line with Pyongyang.</p>
<p>The latest security scare will limit his ability to take initiatives, such as offers of aid, to improve the atmosphere and smooth the way for talks, the analysts said.</p>
