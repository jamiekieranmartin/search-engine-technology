<p>Israeli jets and gunners bombarded villages held by the pro-Iranian Hizbollah in south Lebanon after two Israeli soldiers were killed in an ambush on Thursday, witnesses said.</p>
<p>The bloody flare-up on the last active Arab-Israeli warfront coincided with a visit to the region by U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross to help jump-start stalled Middle East peace talks.</p>
<p>The witnesses said Israeli jets fired 10 rockets in three raids into the Iqlim al-Toufah hill country used by Hizbollah (Party of God) guerrillas as a springboard for attacks on Israeli forces occupying a south Lebanon border zone.</p>
<p>There was no word on casualties in the raids.</p>
<p>The air strikes and concurrent artillery shelling began shortly after machinegun-firing Hizbollah fighters ambushed an Israeli patrol on the edge of the, killing two soldiers and wounding two others, pro-Israeli militia sources said.</p>
<p>It was the worst attack against Israeli troops in south Lebanon since five soldiers were killed and six wounded in a Hizbollah attack on June 10. Thursday's casualties raised to 20 the number of Israeli soldiers killed by Hizbollah this year.</p>
<p>Hizbollah, which is fighting to oust Israeli troops from a 15-km (nine-mile) deep border occupation zone, said its fighters clashed with an Israeli force trying to advance out of the zone and into Iqlim al-Toufah near Sojoud village.</p>
<p>The pro-Israeli South Lebanon Army sources said guerrillas fired machineguns and anti-tank rockets on the patrol near Sojoud and Rihane villages shortly after a hail of mortar bombs fired by another group of fighters rained down on the Israelis.</p>
<p>Immediately after the ambush, Israeli gunners opened up with heavy artillery fire for hours into Hizbollah-controlled hills and villages in Iqlim al-Toufah, witnesses and SLA sources said, firing more than 800 shells in several hours.</p>
<p>At least 50 shells slammed inside the villages of Ain Bouswar and Jba'a, wounding a civilian woman in Jba'a who was hurt by flying debris, witnesses said.</p>
<p>Lebanese security sources said sporadic shelling on Iqlim al-Toufah continued in the late afternoon and said the Israelis also lobbed shells near villages north of another sector of the border zone running from Mount Hermon to the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>The fresh shelling followed a mortar bomb attack by Hizbollah fighters against a fortified Israeli army outpost at Braachit. No casualties were reported in that assault.</p>
<p>Hizbollah fighters responded to the earlier bombardment and air strikes with mortar bombs into the zone and fired at least two shoulder-held SAM-7 rockets at the attacking jets, which targeted mainly rugged mountain hideouts and roads.</p>
<p>The Israeli army comfirmed two air strikes, saying that some of the Hizbollah targets hit in Jabal Safi in Iqlim al-Toufah &quot;served as firing positions for terrorists&quot;.</p>
<p>A Hizbollah spokesman in Beirut charged that Israel's targeting of villages and wounding of a civilian woman was a breach of the U.S.-brokered ceasefire agreement that ended a 17-day Israeli blitz on Lebanon in April.</p>
<p>A senior foreign ministry official in Beirut told Reuters that Lebanon was planning to file a complaint over the Israeli shelling of civilian areas to a five-nation committee monitoring the ceasefire agreement in south Lebanon.</p>
<p>Thursday's fighting came a day after Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri said increased Israeli military action in south Lebanon was unlikely.</p>
<p>Some 200 Lebanese, mostly civilians, were killed in Israel's bloody 17-day blitz against Hizbollah guerrillas after tit-for-tat bombardments of civilian areas by the two sides.</p>
<p>The ceasefire agreement barred both sides from targeting civilian areas but allowed guerrilla raids on Israeli forces.</p>
