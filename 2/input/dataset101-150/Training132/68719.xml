<p>A South Korean paratrooper was shot in the head and killed during a helicopter chase for North Korean agents across rugged mountains on Saturday, the defence ministry said.</p>
<p>But in a sign that Seoul wants to limit damage from one of the deadliest infiltrations from the North since the early Cold War, foreign minister Gong Ro-myung said he still wanted peace talks with Pyongyang.</p>
<p>Media reports said the 26-year-old sergeant was hit while being winched to the ground to pursue two communist fugitives. Another paratrooper on the helicopter was also wounded as the infiltrators opened fire with automatic weapons.</p>
<p>It was the first reported Southern fatality in a four-day hunt along east coast mountains for an estimated 26 infiltrators who landed on Wednesday morning by submarine on a beach from the enemy North.</p>
<p>South Korean forces have killed seven of the agents and captured one alive, while the bodies of 11 others were found, possibly shot by saboteurs among the squad who wanted to increase their survival chances.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Gong told reporters that despite the incident, &quot;there will be no change in the government's original position pressing for four-way talks to obtain peace on the Korean peninsula&quot;.</p>
<p>In April, U.S. President Bill Clinton and South Korean President Kim Young-sam proposed four-way talks, also including China, to replace an armistice that ended the 1950-53 Korean War with a peace treaty.</p>
<p>But Gong said he believe the drama would affect the flow of international food aid to North Korea, which is on the brink of famine following disastrous floods.</p>
<p>Several skirmishes broke out on Saturday as a deadly game of cat-and-mouse was played out in wooded ravines.</p>
<p>Loudspeakers on army jeeps boomed out a recorded message from the captured agent, Lee Kwang-soo, pleading with his colleagues to give themselves up.</p>
<p>&quot;I am alive and safe,&quot; according to the message, which echoed around canyons. &quot;Our mission has already been finished. I want you to surrender and find a new life along with me in the Republic of Korea.&quot;</p>
<p>Piecing together the account of the captured agent, defence ministry officials say two of three highly trained saboteurs were still alive and at large. Also missing were the captain of the vessel, two guides and three crew members.</p>
<p>&quot;Our forces are still chasing the two men believed to be saboteurs and squeezing the dragnet,&quot; a defence ministry official in Kangnung said. &quot;We are also hunting another group of three suspected North Korean agents on a nearby hillside after a report from witnesses.&quot;</p>
<p>Defence Minister Lee Yang-ho called the submarine infiltration a military provocation. &quot;The inflitrators seem to have been entrusted with an important mission. We continue to investigate what it was,&quot; he told reporters.</p>
<p>The submarine ended up stranded on rocks, indicating that whatever the mission it had been badly botched. Salvage vessels on Saturday prepared to tow away the vessel.</p>
<p>Television pictures have been playing North Korean propaganda film of spy agents displaying awesome combat skills as frogmen, paratroopers and martial art fighters.</p>
<p>The old movie reels show muscular men being beaten with boards studded with nails and female operatives slicing bottles in half with flashing open-hand chops.</p>
<p>Terrified residents around Kangnung bolted their doors at night, and tourist hotels in the region have emptied ahead of the Korean Thanksgiving, an important national holiday.</p>
<p>Nearby Sorak Mountain is one of the country's best-known resort areas, frequented by millions of South Korean climbers, skiers and other tourists throughout the year.</p>
<p>&quot;We spend every day helpless,&quot; said Chon Song-hee, a female resident at a town on the outskirts of Kangnung. &quot;I feel like I live in the dark. I don't go out even during the daytime.&quot;</p>
