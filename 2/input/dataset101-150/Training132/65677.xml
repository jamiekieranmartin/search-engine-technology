<p>South Korean security forces killed seven more North Koreans on Thursday as one of the deadliest infiltration dramas since the early Cold War played itself out.</p>
<p>An estimated 20 North Koreans came ashore on a beach in the enemy South from a submarine on Wednesday, authorities said.</p>
<p>Altogether 18 have now been shot dead -- 11 in an apparent mass suicide -- and one was captured after a ruthless manhunt by thousands of troops and police.</p>
<p>The defence ministry labelled as incorrect an earlier report a second man had been captured on Thursday, saying he was still on the loose.</p>
<p>The search through mountainous terrain was likely to continue for some time because of uncertainty about the exact number of communist agents dropped near the east coast city of Kangnung.</p>
<p>South Korean security forces took no chances with the heavily-armed North Koreans as they reportedly fled for their lives towards the fortified border that has split the Korean peninsula since the 1950-53 war.</p>
<p>Three were cut down by automatic fire as they crouched by a stream to drink water, military sources in Kangnung said.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the bodies of 11 North Koreans were found huddled together on top of a mountain situated close to a beach where they landed. All had been shot through the head in an apparent mass suicide.</p>
<p>South Korean President Kim Young-sam denounced the most serious infiltration since the 1960s as an act of &quot;military provocation&quot; at a cabinet meeting.</p>
<p>&quot;This is not a simple spy case. I regard it as a kind of military provocation,&quot; an aide quoted Kim as saying.</p>
<p>&quot;Despite food shortages, the reason why North Korea sent armed infiltrators is that they still have not given up their ambition to reunify Korea by force,&quot; Kim said. Impoverished North Korea is on the brink of famine.</p>
<p>The head of the Agency for National Security Planning, Kwon Young-hae, was quoted as saying the incident amounted to &quot;infiltration by armed guerrillas&quot;.</p>
<p>North Korea refused to accept a protest by the U.S.-led United Nations Command in South Korea, a command statement said.</p>
<p>The U.N. Command attempted to hand the message to the North through the border crossing village of Panmunjom, but a Northern military duty officer would not take it, the statement said.</p>
<p>The U.N. Command was the supreme headquarters for international and South Korean forces which repelled North Korean invaders in the Korean War. It now helps supervise the armistice that ended the war.</p>
<p>&quot;I strongly demand that your side immediately take the necessary steps to prevent recurrence of these serious Armistice Agreement violations,&quot; said the letter signed by South Korean general Cha Ki Moon.</p>
<p>&quot;If you fail to do so, the responsibility for the unfortunate consequences will be yours.&quot;</p>
<p>Security forces with sniffer dogs have combed the Kangnung area since the submarine was spotted early on Wednesday wedged on a reef. Helicopters and a reconnaissance plane were also used.</p>
<p>Security was also beefed up around Seoul, with manned checkpoints on bridges leading into the capital and armed police posted conspicuously in busy shopping districts.</p>
<p>Authorities said the submarine struck rocks while returning from a mission to drop off infiltrators, but one of the captured North Koreans was reported to have said the vessel went aground after drifting for a day with engine trouble.</p>
<p>Troops who boarded the abandoned grey craft found automatic guns and ammunition along with canned food and shoes.</p>
<p>Defence officials on Thursday shrugged off media criticism that South Korean defence forces had not managed to detect the 34 metre (111 ft) long submarine.</p>
<p>&quot;Detecting such a small-sized submarine is like searching for a needle in a big river,&quot; a naval officer told reporters.</p>
