<p>South Korean troops on Wednesday staged a massive night-time manhunt for an estimated eight or nine North Koreans still at large after a submarine went aground and 11 suspected infiltrators were found shot dead.</p>
<p>The search followed a day in which South Korea had to face up to what was apparently the most serious infiltration from the communist North since the 1960s.</p>
<p>Seoul angrily denounced it as a breach of the 1953 Korean War armistice agreement which sealed the partition of the peninsula. There was no immediate reaction from the Northern capital, Pyongyang.</p>
<p>Authorities believe around 20 North Koreans were landed by submarine on a beach south of the border between the two hostile states.</p>
<p>A taxi driver spotted the submarine soon after midnight on Tuesday, stranded on rocks nine kilometres (5.6 miles) south of the east coast city of Kangnung.</p>
<p>Authorities said it had apparently hit a reef while attempting to return to the North after dropping off the infiltrators.</p>
<p>Later the bloodsoaked bodies of 11 of the North Koreans were found on top of a mountain, dressed in jeans and sneakers.</p>
<p>&quot;One of the dead infiltrators had a gun on him and we think he killed himself after shooting the others,&quot; a Defence Ministry spokesman told a news conference.</p>
<p>A 12th man was captured alive after authorities launched the huge manhunt, and his initial testimony apparently contradicted the official version of a planned mass infiltration.</p>
<p>Television news reports said Lee Kang-soo, 31, told interrogators the submarine had drifted into South Korean waters after developing engine trouble.</p>
<p>There was speculation that the submarine could have been sent to pick up an agent or drop off a small unit of spies -- and that the mission then went badly wrong.</p>
<p>Television pictures showed the abandoned vessel bobbing helplessly in the water. Troops who boarded the grey craft found automatic guns and ammunition, along with canned food and shoes.</p>
<p>Thousands of troops and police using sniffer dogs combed terrain around the beach as helicopters roared overhead. They set up checkpoints on all main roads. Naval vessels and a reconnaissance plane joined the search.</p>
<p>After authorities imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew in the area, two North Koreans burst into a village home and stole food and cigarettes from the owner at gunpoint, state radio reported.</p>
<p>Later, security forces exchanged gunfire with two infiltrators near an airport serving Kangnung, television news said. The skirmish lasted for about 15 minutes but the two managed to evade capture.</p>
<p>&quot;This incident is a grave provocation and a definite infiltration against South Korea by North Korea,&quot; Kim Dong-shin, director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told a news conference.</p>
<p>Unification Minister Kwon O-kie chaired a meeting of cabinet ministers who deal with security-related matters which declared the infiltration &quot;a direct threat to our national security&quot;, a Unification Ministry statement said.</p>
<p>Yonhap news agency quoted a former North Korean commando, captured while on a mission to kill South Korea's president in 1968, as saying the submarine could have been planning to bring home a Pyongyang agent.</p>
<p>&quot;The submarine may have hit rocks by mistake and then all members of the crew fled onto land after finding it impossible to go back,&quot; Kim Shin-jo was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>Adding weight to this speculation were signs of panic flight, with personal belongings scattered along a road.</p>
<p>Wednesday's drama was one of the most deadly since 1968 when 31 North Koreans reached the presidential Blue House in Seoul. Twenty-eight were killed in a gunbattle in which 34 Southern troops, police and civilians also died.</p>
<p>Shin Sang-kil, deputy head of operations of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters troops had found a machinegun with 75 rounds of ammunition, a Soviet-made rifle with 100 bullets and 75 other bullets on the vessel.</p>
<p>The Defence Ministry said the Sang-o class submarine measured 34 metres (111 ft) in length and weighed 330 tonnes. North Korea has about 10 of these submarines, each capable of carrying 21 people, a ministry official said.</p>
