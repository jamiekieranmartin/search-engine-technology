<p>Eleven North Korean infiltrators put ashore on Wednesday in the South by a submarine were found dead, possibly shot by one of their number who also used the gun on himself, a South Korean defence ministry spokesman said.</p>
<p>A 12th infiltrator was captured alive and another eight or nine were still at large, the spokesman told a news conference.</p>
<p>&quot;One of the dead infiltrators had a gun on him and we think he killed himself after shooting the others,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The bodies were found on top of a mountain near the east coast city of Kangnung during a massive air-and-sea search, the spokesman said.</p>
<p>Authorities believed a total of around 20 infiltrators landed on a beach just south of the border with North Korea. That was double their initial estimate of the number of infiltrators.</p>
<p>The submarine was found grounded in waters nine kilometres (5.6 miles) south of Kangnung. It apparently hit a rock while returning to the North.</p>
<p>On board were weapons and ammunition, along with canned food and shoes.</p>
<p>Early on Wednesday troops and police fanned out across terrain surrounding the beach while helicopters roared overhead. They set up roadblocks on all main roads and there were unconfirmed reports of a gunbattle in the morning.</p>
<p>Naval vessels and a reconnaissance plane joined the search offshore.</p>
<p>The director of operations at the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Kim Dong-shin, told reporters the incident was a violation of an armistice agreement that ended the 1950-53 Korean War.</p>
<p>&quot;This incident is a grave provocation and a definite infiltration against South Korea by North Korea,&quot; he said. &quot;Our military, stepping up vigilance, has launched a wide-ranging search to seize the infiltrators.&quot;</p>
<p>Media reports said two men armed with rifles and believed to be infiltrators attacked a villager on the outskirts of Kangnung before heading into nearby hills.</p>
<p>Yonhap news agency quoted Kim Chang-soo, 35, as saying the men battered him with an aluminium bar. It said there had been other sightings of strangers in military uniform.</p>
<p>Shin Sang-kil, deputy head of operations of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told a news conference that troops found a machinegun with 75 rounds of ammunition, a Soviet-made rifle with 100 bullets and other 75 other bullets on the vessel.</p>
<p>A written pledge of loyalty to North Korean leader Kim Jong-il was also found. Military clothing, keys and a life jacket were recovered on a nearby road.</p>
<p>The defence ministry said the Sang-o class submarine measured 34 metres (111 ft) in length and weighed 330 tonnes. North Korea has about 10 of these submarines, each capable of carrying 21 people, a ministry official said.</p>
<p>Television pictures showed the grey vessel bobbing helplessly in the water.</p>
<p>There have been several North Korean spy scares over the past year, further raising tension between the Koreas. Numbers of North Korean defectors have also been increasing as food shortages grip the Stalinist state.</p>
<p>Wednesday's drama was one of the most deadly since 1968 when 31 North Koreans reached the presidential Blue House in Seoul. Twenty eight were killed in a gunbattle in which 34 Southern troops, police and civilians also died.</p>
<p>In October last year a North Korean was captured and his companion was killed a few days later in a clash with security forces in the southern part of South Korea.</p>
<p>In July, a history professor in a Seoul university admitted he was a North Korean agent who had spied for his country over the past decade. He disguised himself as a Filipino and even married a South Korean woman.</p>
