<p>South Korean troops killed another North Korean infiltrator on Saturday, bringing to 21 the number of agents shot dead since they came ashore from a submarine last week, the defence ministry said.</p>
<p>&quot;He was killed during a gunfight with South Korean troops,&quot; a defence ministry spokesman said. Later, a ministry official said the dead infiltrator had been wearing South Korean military uniform.</p>
<p>The infiltrator was one of five still thought to be on the run after the submarine foundered on an east cost reef on Wednesday last week.</p>
<p>Earlier, South Korean foreign minister Gong Ro-myung told the United Nations General Assembly that communist North Korea could be planning more commando-style infiltration raids.</p>
<p>North Korea's U.N. ambassador immediately countered by saying Pyongyang's patience was running out and it reserved the right to retaliate if the submarine and surviving and dead crew were not returned.</p>
<p>Of the 26 infiltrators throught to have landed, 10 have been hunted down and killed by Southern troops, 11 were found shot dead -- possibly killed by their own colleagues -- and one was captured alive.</p>
<p>Pyongyang ambassador Park Soo Gil added an ominous warning in his demand in the United Nations for the return of the vessel.</p>
<p>&quot;We cannot remain a victim for an indefinite period ... Time is not unlimited,&quot; he told the assembly.</p>
<p>In his speech, Gong renewed an appeal to the North to join peace talks that would end the state of armed truce on the Korean peninsula.</p>
<p>South Korea and the United States have urged North Korea to join four-nation peace talks along with China to establish a permanent peace to replace the armistice that ended the 1950-53 Korean war.</p>
<p>Gong denounced what he called a &quot;brazen act of military provocation&quot;, which he said showed Pyongyang &quot;seeks Korean unification by any means including force&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;The investigtion is still under way to find out the purpose of the infiltration ... but the findings to date present a strong possibility that last week's infiltration is part of a larger scale infiltration operation,&quot; he said.</p>
