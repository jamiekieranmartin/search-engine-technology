<p>A South Korean soldier injured in a gunbattle with North Korean infiltrators on Monday died in hospital on Wednesday, a defence ministry spokesman said.</p>
<p>Army corporal Kim Dae-young was the fourth Southern soldier to die in a hunt for an estimated 26 North Koreans who came ashore from a submarine last week.  </p>
<p>&quot;He died of head injuries sustained during the shootout,&quot; the defence ministry spokesman said.</p>
<p>Last week a sergeant assigned to a paratrooper unit, another army corporal and a private were shot and killed in separate gunfights with heavily-armed North Korean agents in mountains near the east coast city of Kangnung.</p>
<p>So far 20 infiltrators have been killed and one captured. South Korean forces have shot dead one civilian by mistake.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of security troops were still searching for the remaining fugitives to end one of the deadliest infiltrations by the North since the end of the 1950-53 conflict between the two Koreas.</p>
