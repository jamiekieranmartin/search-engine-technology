<p>Two South Korean soldiers and two North Korean infiltrators were killed on Sunday in two separate armed clashes in rugged east coast mountains, a defence ministry spokesman said.</p>
<p>In one shootout during the night, a Northern agent and a Southern soldier were killed, the spokesman said.</p>
<p>The other Northern infiltrator was killed in the later gunbattle at dawn and a South Korean soldier died while being rushed to a military hospital, he said.</p>
<p>An earlier ministry statement had said all four casualties occurred in the gunbattle at dawn.</p>
<p>The latest casualties brought to nine the number of North Koreans killed by Southern forces in a massive hunt for an estimated 26 communist agents who landed by submarine on Wednesday on a beach near the east coast city of Kangnung.</p>
<p>Eleven other agents were found shot dead, possibly killed by their colleagues, and one was captured alive.</p>
<p>A total of three Southern troops have now been reported killed in a deadly game of cat-and-mouse over mountain trails covered with thick vegetation.</p>
<p>A Southern paratrooper was killed on Saturday. According to some reports he was hit while dangling on a winch line from a helicopter that was lowering him to the ground. Another paratrooper was injured.</p>
<p>An army officer in Kangnung said one of the North Koreans killed on Sunday was wearing a Southern army uniform while the other was in civilian clothes. He said a rifle and a grenade were found at the scene.</p>
<p>A defence ministry official in Kangnung said South Korean naval ships began towing away the North Korean submarine. He declined to elaborate on details, including the destination.</p>
<p>Thousands of troops backed by helicopters have been engaged in a massive manhunt to end one of the deadlist operations from the enemy North since the early Cold War.</p>
<p>South and North Korea have been technically at war since their 1950-53 conflict ended only with an armistice agreement.</p>
<p>Details of the Northern infiltration remain confused, although the defence ministry believes that the agents included three elite saboteurs. These three may have been responsible for the execution-style killings of the 11 on Wednesday in a ruthless bid to improve their own survival chances.</p>
<p>Authorities trying to unravel the mystery of the mission -- which ran into serious trouble when the submarine grounded on a reef -- are relying on statements from the captured North Korean agent, who has changed his story several times.</p>
<p>The Hankook Ilbo daily on Sunday quoted agent Lee Kwang-soo as telling interrogators the team carried high explosives.</p>
<p>It said this suggested the mission could have been intended to stage a terrorist-style attack or destroy key facilities.</p>
<p>Lee was quoted as saying the explosives may have been thrown into the sea or hidden on land.</p>
<p>In an incident unrelated to the infiltration drama later on Sunday, a South Korean army private, armed with a rifle and dozens of rounds of ammunition, was involved in a confrontation with troops after deserting from his barracks near the inter-Korean border, a second defence ministry spokesman said.</p>
<p>The deserter fled into a nearby border area, which had been mined to prevent North Korean infiltrations, after opening fire at random and throwing two hand grenades into a kitchen and barracks at his unit, the spokesman said. Nine soldiers were wounded in the incident.</p>
<p>Several of the soldiers attacked by the deserter were wounded seriously and rushed to a miltiary hospital, he said.</p>
