<p>South Korean troops and helicopters launched a hunt on Wednesday for suspected North Korean infiltrators after a small submarine was found off the east coast, the Defence Ministry said.</p>
<p>State television quoted witnesses as saying five or six men dressed in military uniforms had been heading inland.</p>
<p>&quot;We found a vessel off the eastern coast and troops and police are searching for infiltrators,&quot; a Defence Ministry spokesman said.</p>
<p>The vessel was found grounded near a beach close to the border with North Korea.</p>
<p>Checkpoints have been set up along all roads in the area.</p>
<p>North and South Korea have been technically at war since their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce.</p>
<p>The domestic Yonhap news agency said authorities had found 151 bullets for automatic weapons, a life jacket, three black jumpers, two pairs of trousers, a pack of cigarettes and a lighter on the beach.</p>
<p>It said the vessel was made from plastic material, making it invisible to electronic detectors.</p>
<p>There have been a number of North Korean spy scares in recent months amid rising tension between the two Koreas. Numbers of North Korean defectors coming to the South have also been rising as food shortages grip the Stalinist state.</p>
<p>South Korea last week boycotted an international investment forum in the North.</p>
