<p>Two more North Korean infiltrators were killed on Sunday during a fierce gun battle with South Korean security forces, the Defence Ministry said.</p>
<p>A ministry spokesman said a South Korean soldier also died in the gun battle and another was injured.</p>
<p>The spokesman gave no further details but an army officer said one of the North Koreans who was killed was dressed in a Southern army uniform and the other wore civilian clothes.</p>
<p>The officer said a rifle and a grenade were recovered from the scene of the gunfight, which took place at dawn.</p>
<p>The latest North Korean infiltrators to be killed were among the remnants of around 26 agents who landed by submarine in the early hours of Wednesday on a beach near the east coast city of Kangnung.</p>
<p>South Korean forces have now killed nine of the agents and captured one alive, while the bodies of 11 others were found, possibly shot by saboteurs among the squad who wanted to increase their survival chances.</p>
<p>The South Korean soldier was the second to die in two days. A paratrooper was shot and killed on Saturday during a helicopter chase for the North Korean agents across rugged mountains near Kangnung.</p>
<p>Media reports said the 26-year-old sergeant was hit in the head while being winched to the ground to pursue two communist fugitives. Another paratrooper on the helicopter was also wounded as the infiltrators opened fire with automatic weapons.</p>
<p>Thousands of South Korean security forces have been engaged in a massive manhunt to capture the remaining North Korean agents to end one of the deadlist infiltrations from the North since the early Cold War.</p>
<p>South and North Korea are still technically at war after their 1950-53 conflict which ended only with an armistice agreement.</p>
