<p>Israeli jets and artillery blasted Hizbollah targets in south Lebanon on Saturday after one Israeli officer was wounded in clashes with the Moslem guerrillas there, security sources said.</p>
<p>They said the jets fired several rockets in four attacks into Mlita hill and Jabal Safi in Iqlim al-Toufah ridge which is used by the pro-Iranian Shi'ite Moslem Hizbollah fighters to attack Israeli troops occupying a south Lebanon border zone.</p>
<p>In Israel, the army said an officer was wounded in an attack by Hizbollah (Party of God) guerrillas and confirmed the air raids, saying the pilots reported accurate hits.</p>
<p>It was not immediately known if there were any casualties in the air raids and concurrent artillery bombardment of Iqlim al-Toufah which followed the attacks against two Israeli outposts at Sojoud and Beir Kallab and forces stationed nearby.</p>
<p>Pro-Israeli South Lebanon Army (SLA) militia sources said the guerrillas fired mortar bombs and anti-tank rockets.</p>
<p>&quot;An Israel Defence Forces officer was lightly wounded this morning after an anti-tank missile was fired at an IDF force which was operating in the north of the eastern sector of the south Lebanon security zone,&quot; the Israeli army said.</p>
<p>&quot;The officer was taken to hospital for treatment. The IDF returned fire,&quot; it added in a statement.</p>
<p>In Beirut, Hizbollah claimed responsibility for the assault, saying its fighters rocketed a tank and attacked the Sojoud and Beir Kallab posts.</p>
<p>&quot;AT 1215 p.m. (0915 GMT) the enemy, backed by tanks and heavy machinery, tried to advance into the liberated areas. Our strugglers confronted it and clash with it using all sorts of weapons. A tank was directly hit,&quot; the group said.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Israeli jets raided Iqlim al-Toufah hills and artillery bombarded the area, including Hizbollah-held villages there, in retaliation for a Hizbollah attack that killed two Israeli soldiers and wounded eight.</p>
<p>Hizbollah (Party of God) fighters, who have killed 20 Israeli soldiers this year in south Lebanon, are battling to oust the Israeli forces from a 15-km (nine-miles)-deep zone they have occupied in south Lebanon since 1985</p>
<p>Saturday's clashes came a day before a scheduled meeting of a five-nation committee monitoring a ceasefire understanding -- which ended a 17-day Israeli blitz on Lebanon in April -- to look into Israeli and Lebanese complaints.</p>
<p>Lebanon has filed a complaint that Israel shelled civilian areas on Thursday. Israel said it would complain the guerrillas fired on its forces from inside three villages.</p>
<p>According to witnesses, some 50 shells slammed inside the villages of Ain Bouswar and Jba'a on Thursday, wounding a civilian woman in Jba'a who was hurt by flying debris.</p>
<p>The representatives of the United States, France, Syria, Lebanon and Israel will meet on Sunday in the town of Naqoura, south Lebanon.</p>
<p>Some 200 Lebanese, mostly civilians, were killed in the April onslaught, dubbed by Israel &quot;Operation Grapes of Wrath&quot;, after tit-for-tat bombardments of civilian areas by both sides.</p>
