<p>North Korea on Friday accused South Korea of taking &quot;provocative action&quot; earlier this week but made no reference to North Koreans who landed in the South from a submarine and fought fatal gun battles.</p>
<p>&quot;The South Korean puppets, on the 17th and 18th (of September), took successive provocative action against North Korea near the demilitarised zone,&quot; Korean Central Radio was quoted as saying on Friday by the independent news agency Radio Press, which monitors North Korean radio broadcasts from Japan.</p>
<p>Radiopress said North Korean media have so far not made any direct mention of the submarine incident, which South Korean authorities say began on Wednesday with the landing of infiltrators from the vessel.</p>
<p>But Radiopress said the radio broadcast, which criticised a series of naval exercises it said South Korea carried out in August, was a veiled reaction to the incident.</p>
<p>Referring to the naval exercises, the broadcast said: &quot;The anti-submarine exercises which the (South Korean) puppet navy carried out are a grave threat to our nation.&quot;</p>
<p>On Thursday, Korean Central Radio said South Korean soldiers stationed at the demilitarised zone dividing the two countries positioned guns, mobilised more than 1,000 troops and carried out &quot;exercises to attack and invade the north&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Kim Young-sam and his clique must consider thoroughly the destructive consequences of taking such dangerous, provocative action near a border where the two sides are confronting each other, and must not become frantic,&quot; the radio said.</p>
<p>South Korean authorities have described the submarine incident as the most serious infiltration since the 1960s and a military provocation. North and South Korea have remained technically at war since the 1950-53 Korean conflict ended in a truce.</p>
<p>Seoul originally said 20 North Koreans landed in South Korea from the submarine, but now says the number may be more than that.</p>
<p>Eighteen of have so far been shot dead and one captured alive after landing on a beach near the border in a small submarine and clashing with South Korean forces.</p>
<p>South Korean forces continued searching for other North Koreans on Friday after fierce gun battles raged through the night around disused coal mines in mountains near the east coast city of Kangnung.</p>
