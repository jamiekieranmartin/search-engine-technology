<p>A South Korean paratrooper was shot in the head and killed during a helicopter chase for two North Korean agents across rugged mountains on Saturday, hospital officials said.  </p>
<p>&quot;He died of head injuries,&quot; an official at a hospital in the east coast city of Kangnung said by telephone.</p>
<p>Television news reports said the 26-year-old sergeant was hit while being winched to the ground to pursue the two communist fugitives on foot.</p>
<p>A defence ministry official in Kangnung said another paratrooper on board the helicopter was also shot, but there were no details of his condition.</p>
<p>The agents are the remnants of a squad of about 26 North Korean infiltrators who landed by submarine in the early hours of Wednesday morning on a beach near Kangnung. So far 18 have been shot and killed and one captured alive.</p>
