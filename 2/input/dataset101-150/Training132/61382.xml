<p>Eleven North Korean infiltrators found dead on Wednesday had been shot, probably by one of their number who then turned the gun on himself, a South Korean defence ministry spokesman said.</p>
<p>A twelfth member of the infiltration squad has been captured alive and another eight or nine are still at large, the spokesman told a news conference.  </p>
<p>&quot;One of the dead infiltrators had a gun on him and we think he killed himself after shooting the others,&quot; the spokesman said.</p>
<p>He said authorities now believed a total of around 20 infiltrators had been put ashore on Wednesday by a submarine on the east coast of the Korean peninsula just south of the border with North Korea.</p>
<p>&quot;We're now searching for eight to nine infiltrators still at large,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Earlier, authorities said about 10 North Koreans had sneaked on to a beach. Police and troops have launched a massive air-and-sea search.</p>
