<p>A second South Korean soldier died of his wounds after a shootout with North Korean infiltrators on Sunday in which two communist agents were also killed, a defence ministry spokesman said.  </p>
<p>The gunbattle broke out at dawn as Southern security forces pursued the remnants of a group of around 26 agents who landed by submarine on a beach near the east cost city of Kangnung on Wednesday.</p>
<p>South Korean forces have now killed nine of the agents and captured one alive, while the bodies of 11 others were found, possibly shot by their colleagues.</p>
<p>Three South Korean troops have been reported killed during a deadly game of cat-and-mouse.</p>
<p>A Southern paratrooper was shot and killed on Saturday. According to some media reports he was shot while dangling on a winch line from a helicopter that was lowering him to the ground.</p>
