<p>South Korea said a group of around 10 North Korean infiltrators landed on Wednesday in a submarine, and troops and police backed by helicopters were hunting for them.</p>
<p>State-backed Yonhap television reported an exchange of gunfire between the infiltrators and security forces, but the report could not be confirmed.</p>
<p>A South Korean defence official said the submarine was found in waters nine km (six miles) south of the east coast city of Kangnung. It apparently struck a rock while returning to the North after landing the infiltrators on a beach.</p>
<p>Shin Sang-kil, deputy head of operations of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told a news conference troops found a machinegun with 75 rounds of ammunition, a Soviet-made rifle with 100 bullets and 75 other bullets on the vessel.</p>
<p>In addition, air force clothing, keys and a life jacket were also recovered.</p>
<p>&quot;There have been reports of gunfire being heard but we cannot confirm the clash yet,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said the boat was designed to carry 12 people. Footprints on the beach suggested about 10 people had come ashore.</p>
<p>The director of operations at the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Kim Dong-shin, told reporters the incident was a violation of an armistice agreement that ended the 1950-53 Korean War.</p>
<p>&quot;This incident is a grave provocation and a definite infiltration against South Korea by North Korea,&quot; he said. &quot;Our military, stepping up vigilance, has launched a wide-ranging search to seize the infiltrators.&quot;</p>
<p>He urged the public to inform security forces about sightings of any strangers.</p>
<p>The Korea Broadcasting System quoted witnesses as saying five or six men in military uniform had headed inland.</p>
<p>Shin said the 60-tonne submarine was 15 metres (49 ft) long. News reports said it was constructed of plastic material to make it invisible to electronic detectors. North Korea has around 50 such vessels, used mainly for espionage.</p>
<p>Checkpoints have been set up along main roads in the area.</p>
<p>There have been several North Korean spy scares over the past year, further raising tension between the Koreas. Numbers of North Korean defectors have also been increasing as food shortages grip the Stalinist state.</p>
<p>The most deadly episode occurred in 1968 when 31 North Koreans reached the presidential Blue House in Seoul. Twenty eight were killed in a gunbattle in which 34 Southern troops, police and civilians also died. One of the infiltrators was arrested while two fled.</p>
<p>Since then there have been 20 reported infiltrations.</p>
<p>In October last year a North Korean was captured and his companion was killed a few days later in a clash with security forces in the southern part of South Korea.</p>
<p>And in July a history professor in a Seoul university admitted to being a North Korean agent who had spied for his country over the past decade. He disguised himself as a Filipino and even married a South Korean woman.</p>
<p>North Korean infiltrations are part of a war of nerves between the two Koreas, who are still technically at war.</p>
<p>South Korea last week boycotted an international investment forum in the North.</p>
