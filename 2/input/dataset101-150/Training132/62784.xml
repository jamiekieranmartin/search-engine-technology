<p>Bodies of 11 suspected North Korean infiltrators have been found, a defence ministry spokesman said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>He gave no details. Television news gave conflicting reports about whether the infiltrators, landed by submarine in South Korea earlier on Wednesday, were killed by South Korean security forces or committed suicide.  </p>
<p>Earlier, Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation said one infiltrator had been captured alive and was being taken to a police station in the coastal city of Kangnung. The defence ministry spokesman could not confirm the report.</p>
<p>Yonhap television said the 11 others had been shot. However, the Korea Broadcasting System said they had blown themselves up.</p>
<p>A massive air and sea search has been under way since the early hours of Wednesday morning.</p>
