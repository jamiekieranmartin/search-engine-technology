<headline>N.Korea infiltrators clash with troops in South - TV.</headline>

<p>A group of North Korean infiltrators on Wednesday clashed with South Korean forces after landing on a beach in a small submarine, state-backed television reported.</p>
<p>Yonhap television said the infiltrators exchanged gunfire with troops and police pursuing them on a hill near the east coast city of Kangnung.</p>
<p>A defence ministry spokesman said he could not confirm reports of the clash.</p>
<p>Earlier, the spokesman said troops and helicopters were hunting for infiltrators after a submarine was found grounded off a beach near the border with North Korea.</p>
<p>&quot;We found a vessel off the eastern coast and troops and police are searching for infiltrators,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The Korea Broadcasting System quoted witnesses as saying five or six men in military uniform were headed inland. Later, it said as many as 10 North Koreans had landed.</p>
<p>Rifles and clothing had been found on board the 20 metre (65 foot) long submarine constructed of plastic material to make it invisible to electronic detectors. North Korea has around 50 of such vessels used mainly for espionage.</p>
<p>Checkpoints have been set up along all main roads in the area.</p>
<p>North and South Korea have been technically at war since their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce.</p>
<p>State media said South Korea's Chief of Joint Staff, Kim Dong-jin, was personally leading the search.</p>
<p>Kim was quoted as saying the incident was a provocation that violated the armistice agreement that ended the Korean War and Seoul would protest to Pyongyang.</p>
<p>The domestic Yonhap news agency said authorities had discovered 151 bullets for automatic weapons, a life jacket, three black jumpers, two pairs of trousers, a pack of cigarettes and a lighter on the beach.</p>
<p>There have been a number of North Korean spy scares in recent months, further raising tension between the two Koreas. Numbers of North Korean defectors coming to the South have also been increasing as food shortages grip the Stalinist state.</p>
<p>South Korea last week boycotted an international investment forum in the North.</p>
