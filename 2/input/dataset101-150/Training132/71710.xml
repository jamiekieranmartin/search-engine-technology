<p>South Korean troops shot dead a civilian by mistake on Monday as they hunted for an estimated five North Korean infiltrators still on the run, a defence ministry official said.  </p>
<p>The official told a news conference the victim, a 56-year-old man, was spotted by security forces just after dawn walking up a mountain near an area where clashes had occurred sporadically during the night.</p>
<p>&quot;He was going to pick wild mushrooms,&quot; the official said. &quot;Troops opened fire after sighting him.&quot; Local residents have been warned against moving in the mountains.</p>
<p>The official said two South Korean soldiers were injured and taken to hospital during the overnight gun battles.</p>
<p>It was the first civilian fatality since the search began last Wednesday for an estimated 26 North Koreans who landed by submarine on an east coast beach. Twenty infiltrators have been shot and killed and one captured alive. In addition, three South Korean troops have been killed.</p>
