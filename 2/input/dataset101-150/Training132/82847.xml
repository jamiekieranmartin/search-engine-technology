<p>North Korea warned on Friday that it would exercise its &quot;right to retaliate&quot; if South Korea fails to return a submarine and its surviving and dead crew members who landed in the South last week.</p>
<p>&quot;Our retaliation may be hundredfold or thousandfold. No matter what kind of retaliation we may make, the South Korean puppets will be wholly to blame,&quot; said a statement carried by Pyongyang's official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) and monitored in Tokyo.</p>
<p>It was the second straight day of warnings from Pyongyang's official media over the submarine incident. On Thursday, North Korea said without elaborating that it would take strong measures against South Korea over the deaths of some of the North Koreans.</p>
<p>Seoul estimates 26 North Koreans went ashore in South Korea from the submarine on Wednesday last week. Nine have since been killed by South Korean security forces, 11 were found shot dead -- possibly murdered by their own colleagues -- and one was captured. South Korean authorities have been searching for the others.</p>
<p>Thousands of South Korean troops backed by helicopters have been engaged in a massive manhunt in an effort to end what has been one of the deadliest North-South clashes since early in the Cold War.</p>
<p>&quot;The South Korean authorities must immediately stop their ill-intentioned campaign over our wrecked boat and return our submarine and surviving and dead crewmen immediately and unconditionally,&quot; the KCNA statement said.</p>
<p>&quot;As victims, we have the right to retaliate on the offenders,&quot; said the statement, which reiterated Pyongyang's assertion that the submarine accidentally drifted into the South's waters.</p>
<p>Seoul has dismissed North Korea's explanation for the incursion as &quot;not worthy of consideration&quot;.</p>
<p>South and North Korea have been technically at war since their 1950-53 conflict ended only with an armistice agreement.</p>
