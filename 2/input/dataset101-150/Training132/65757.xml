<p>Another North Korean infiltrator was killed by security forces in South Korea on Thursday and one captured, a defence ministry spokesman in the east coast city of Kangnung said.</p>
<p>The latest killing brought to 18 the number shot dead since a group of around 20 North Koreans landed by submarine on Wednesday. Altogether two have been captured.  </p>
<p>The latest infiltrator to die was killed in a shootout, the spokesman said. A companion was captured nearby.</p>
<p>Earlier on Thursday six North Koreans were shot and killed, three of them cut down by automatic fire as they crouched by a stream to drink water.</p>
<p>Eleven others were found dead on top of a mountain on Wednesday in an apparent group suicide.</p>
<p>A massive hunt is continuing because there is still some doubt over the exact number of agents that landed on a beach near Kangnung in the early hours of Wednesday morning, military sources said.</p>
