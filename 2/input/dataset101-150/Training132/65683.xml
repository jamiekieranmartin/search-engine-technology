<p>South Korean security forces on Thursday killed six North Korean infiltrators as they ruthlessly hunted down the last of around 20 agents who slipped into the country on Wednesday by submarine.</p>
<p>Three were cut down by automatic fire as they crouched by a stream to drink water, according to military sources in the east coast city of Kangnung.</p>
<p>A fourth infiltrator standing guard for his colleagues slipped away, they said.</p>
<p>Later, another three were killed by security forces, a defence ministry spokesman said in Seoul. He gave no details.</p>
<p>On Wednesday the bodies of 11 North Koreans were found huddled together on top of a mountain situated close to a beach where they landed. All had been shot through the head in an apparent mass suicide.</p>
<p>Another was captured alive and was being interrogated over the most serious infiltration from the communist North since the 1960s. The two Koreas have been technically at war since their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce.</p>
<p>Long lines of troops cradling rifles snaked over rugged mountain terrain around Kangnung to hunt for the last two agents believed to be still on the run. Helicopters clattered overhead as the troops poked through the undergrowth.</p>
<p>South Korean President Kim Young-sam denounced the infiltration as an act of &quot;military provocation&quot; at a cabinet meeting, a presidential spokesman said.</p>
<p>&quot;This is not a simple spy case. I regard it as a kind of military provocation,&quot; he quoted Kim as saying.</p>
<p>&quot;Despite food shortages, the reason why North Korea sent armed infiltrators is that they still have not given up their ambition to reunify Korea by force,&quot; Kim said. Impoverished North Korea is on the brink of famine.</p>
<p>The head of the Agency for National Security Planning, Kwon O-kie, was quoted as saying the incident amounted to &quot;infiltration by armed guerrillas&quot;.</p>
<p>North Korea refused to accept a protest by the U.S.-led United Nations Command in South Korea over the infiltration, a statement from the command said.</p>
<p>It said the U.N. Command attempted to hand the message to the North through the border crossing village of Panmunjom, but a Northern military duty officer would not take it.</p>
<p>The U.N. Command was the supreme headquarters for international and South Korean forces that repelled North Korean invaders in the Korean War. It now helps supervise the armistice that ended the war.</p>
<p>&quot;I strongly demand that your side immediately take the necessary steps to prevent recurrence of these serious Armistice Agreement violations,&quot; said the letter signed by South Korean general Cha Ki Moon.</p>
<p>&quot;If you fail to do so, the responsibility for the unfortunate consequences will be yours.&quot;</p>
<p>A defence ministry spokesman in Seoul said the remaining fugitives were apparently trying to flee home by land.</p>
<p>&quot;Villagers have reported that some suspected infiltrators asked about roads leading to the Taebaek mountains,&quot; he said. The mountain range straddles the frontier.</p>
<p>Thousands of troops and police with sniffer dogs have been combing the Kangnung area since the submarine was spotted early on Wednesday wedged on a reef.</p>
<p>Authorities said it struck rocks while returning from a mission to drop off infiltrators, but the captured North Korean was reported as saying it went aground after drifting for a day because of engine trouble.</p>
<p>Troops who boarded the abandoned grey craft found automatic guns and ammunition along with canned food and shoes.</p>
<p>Defence officials on Thursday shrugged off media criticism that South Korean defence forces had not managed to detect the 34 metre (111 ft) long submarine.</p>
<p>&quot;Detecting such a small-sized submarine is like searching for a needle in a big river,&quot; a naval officer told reporters.</p>
