<p>North Korea warned on Friday that it would exercise its &quot;right to retaliate&quot; if South Korea failed to return a submarine and its surviving and dead crew members who landed in the South last week.</p>
<p>&quot;Our retaliation may be hundredfold or thousandfold,&quot; a statement carried by the official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said, adding to a war of words flying across the inter-Korean border.</p>
<p>&quot;No matter what kind of retaliation we may make, the South Korean puppets will be wholly to blame. Firing should be answered with firing.&quot;</p>
<p>They were the sharpest comments yet by Pyongyang following the intrusion of the submarine that put ashore an estimated 26 armed North Koreans.</p>
<p>South Korean security forces have killed nine of the infiltrators, 11 were found dead -- apparently shot by their own colleagues -- one was captured alive and a hunt is on for five others still believed to be on the loose.</p>
<p>South Korea's defence ministry on Friday shrugged off an earlier threat by Pyongyang to take &quot;strong&quot; measures over the killings.</p>
<p>&quot;The warning to take strong measures against the South is really absurd. It is an evildoer's audacity and is not worthy of comment,&quot; ministry spokesman Yoon Chang-ro said in a written statement. &quot;It's nothing but a dirty plot to hide its assassination of the 11 North Koreans.</p>
<p>&quot;We sternly warn you that we will definitely take a firm stance against any North Korean provocations.&quot;</p>
<p>North Korea's latest statement repeated its contention that the submarine was on a routine training mission and had strayed into Southern waters after developing engine trouble, ending up on rocks near the east coast city of Kangnung.</p>
<p>&quot;As victims, we have the right to retaliate against the offenders,&quot; the KCNA statement said, adding that Seoul was using the incident for &quot;sinister political purposes&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;The South Korean authorities must immediately stop their ill-intentioned campaign over our wrecked boat and return our submarine and surviving and dead crewmen immediately and unconditionally.&quot;</p>
<p>South Korea maintains the submarine was on a carefully-planned commando infiltration mission possibly aimed at blowing up key installations.</p>
<p>The United States has also denounced what it called a military provocation that breached the armistice agreement ending the 1950-53 Korean War.</p>
<p>Giving weight to Seoul's version of events, the bodies of some of the dead infiltrators were found wearing South Korean military uniforms. Several were armed with rifles.</p>
<p>A massive manhunt for the five remaining infiltrators continued for the 10th consecutive day on Friday in rugged mountains near Kangnung.</p>
<p>Security forces have distributed photomontages of the five based on descriptions by captured agent Lee Kwang-soo.</p>
<p>On Friday they eased restrictions on local residents entering the mountains to enable them to visit their ancestors' tombs during the Korean Thanksgiving holiday. But visitors were told to wear red hats, carry a South Korean flag and move in groups of at least three.</p>
<p>North Korea's deputy foreign minister made no reference to the submarine incident during an address to the United Nations General Assembly on Thursday. However, he said the United Nations should remove its name from the the U.S.-led U.N. Command that supervises the Korean armistice.</p>
