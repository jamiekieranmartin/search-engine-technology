<p>North Korea said on Thursday that it would take &quot;strong&quot; measures against South Korea for killing North Koreans who landed in the South from a submarine last week.</p>
<p>The decision was made at an emergency meeting of the North Korean government, political parties and other organisations, the official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said.  </p>
<p>&quot;The meeting adopted a decision to take a strong counter-measure against the dangerous acts of the Kim Young-sam regime,&quot; KCNA said in a report monitored in Tokyo.</p>
<p>&quot;The meeting participants bitterly denounced the South Korean puppets for brutally killing soldiers of the Korean People's Army who could not but go ashore in Kangrung, South Korea, after an accident during their regular training on September 18,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>&quot;The South Korean puppets should be made to pay dearly for that, it was stressed at the meeting,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>An estimated 26 North Koreans went ashore in South Korea last Wednesday from a submarine. Nine have since been killed by South Korean security forces, 11 were found shot dead -- possibly murdered by their own colleagues -- and one was captured. South Korean authorities have been searching for the others.</p>
