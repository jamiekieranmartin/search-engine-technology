<p>Eleven North Koreans put ashore on Wednesday in the enemy South by a submarine were found dead, possibly shot by one of their number who also used the gun on himself, a Seoul defence ministry spokesman said.</p>
<p>A 12th infiltrator was captured alive and another eight or nine were still at large, the spokesman told a news conference.</p>
<p>&quot;One of the dead infiltrators had a gun on him and we think he killed himself after shooting the others,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The captured North Korean, Lee Kang-soo, 31, told his interrogators the submarine had drifted into South Korean waters after developing engine trouble, television news reports said.</p>
<p>Lee said the vessel left port in North Korea on Monday and began drifting the following day, Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation news reported.</p>
<p>The submarine was found grounded in waters nine kilometres (5.6 miles) south of the east coast city of Kangnung.</p>
<p>Seoul authorities said it apparently hit a rock while returning to the North after dropping off the infiltrators on a beach. But there was also speculation the submarine could have been sent to pick up an agent but the mission went badly wrong.</p>
<p>The bodies were found on top of a mountain near Kangnung during a massive air-and-sea search, the defence ministry spokesman said. The North Korean were dressed in jeans and sneakers.</p>
<p>Authorities believed a total of around 20 infiltrators landed on a beach just south of the border with North Korea. That was double their initial estimate.</p>
<p>On board were weapons and ammunition, along with canned food and shoes.</p>
<p>Early on Wednesday troops and police using sniffer dogs fanned out across terrain surrounding the beach while helicopters roared overhead. They set up roadblocks on all main roads and checked passing cars.</p>
<p>Naval vessels and a reconnaissance plane joined the search offshore.</p>
<p>The director of operations at the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Kim Dong-shin, told reporters the incident was a violation of an armistice agreement that ended the 1950-53 Korean War.</p>
<p>&quot;This incident is a grave provocation and a definite infiltration against South Korea by North Korea,&quot; he said. &quot;Our military, stepping up vigilance, has launched a wide-ranging search to seize the infiltrators.&quot;</p>
<p>Yonhap news agency quoted a former North Korean commando, captured while on a mission to kill South Korea's president in 1968, as saying the submarine may have been planning to bring home a Pyongyang agent.</p>
<p>&quot;The submarine may have hit rocks by mistake and then all members of the crew fled onto land after finding it impossible to go back,&quot; Kim Shin-jo was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>Adding weight to this speculation were signs of panic flight, with weapons and ammunition left in the boat and personal belongings scattered along a road.</p>
<p>Wednesday's drama was one of the most deadly since 1968 when 31 North Koreans reached the presidential Blue House in Seoul. Twenty-eight were killed in a gunbattle in which 34 Southern troops, police and civilians also died.</p>
<p>Shin Sang-kil, deputy head of operations of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told a news conference troops found a machinegun with 75 rounds of ammunition, a Soviet-made rifle with 100 bullets and other 75 other bullets on the vessel.</p>
<p>A written pledge of loyalty to North Korean leader Kim Jong-il was also found. Military clothing, keys and a life jacket were recovered on a nearby road.</p>
<p>The defence ministry said the Sang-o class submarine measured 34 metres (111 ft) in length and weighed 330 tonnes. North Korea has about 10 of these submarines, each capable of carrying 21 people, a ministry official said.</p>
<p>Television pictures showed the grey vessel bobbing helplessly in the water.</p>
