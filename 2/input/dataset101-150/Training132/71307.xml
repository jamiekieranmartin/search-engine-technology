<p>U.S, Defence Secretary William Perry on Monday rejected North Korea's claim that its submarine which foundered off South Korea last week was on a routine mission but he called on Seoul and Pyongyang to calm down.</p>
<p>&quot;All of our evidence suggests that this North Korean submarine was not on a routine mission. And so I would reject the North Korean explanation of the mission,&quot; he told reporters at the close of a visit to Sweden.  </p>
<p>Asked about Pyongyang's explanation of the submarine incident, Perry replied: &quot;Having said that it is important not to let this incident escalate and we want both parties to work to try to keep this from becoming an incident beyond the damage that has already been caused.</p>
<p>&quot;And in particular we still believe it is important to proceed with four-power talks which we proposed some months ago to try to reach finally a peace agreement on the Korean peninsular,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>North Korea said on Monday in its first direct comment on the drama that the submarine had suffered engine failure and it demanded the return of the vessel and crew, including bodies of those killed.</p>
<p>Southern forces have killed nine intruders, found the bodies of 11 believed killed by their own colleagues, captured one North Korean alive, and lost three of their men.</p>
