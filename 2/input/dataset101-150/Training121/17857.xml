<p>China on Tuesday reaffirmed its support for a global nuclear test ban treaty blocked by India last week, saying the pact would be an important step in achieving total nuclear disarmament.</p>
<p>&quot;Although the final draft of the treaty probably didn't totally satisfy any country, it was in general balanced,&quot; the official People's Daily newspaper said in a commentary.</p>
<p>India blocked the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva, saying the pact did not contain a clause committing the five declared nuclear powers to a timetable for nuclear disarmament.</p>
<p>New Delhi's stance, which was seen as effectively thwarting 2-1/2 years of negotiations at the Conference on Disarmament, drew widespread but generally muted foreign criticism.</p>
<p>India has also pledged to oppose any forwarding of the draft treaty to the United Nations General Assembly.</p>
<p>China said many countries had compromised to complete the treaty and that the issue of a disarmament schedule could be discussed in future negotiations.</p>
<p>&quot;The completion of the test ban treaty would be an important and practical step in the gradual process of achieving total nuclear disarmament,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>China has pledged support for the pact since reaching a deal with the United States that made international inspections of nuclear sites more difficult than in earlier drafts of the accord.</p>
<p>The newspaper said China advocated the complete ban and destruction of nuclear weapons but that there was little hope other nuclear powers would soon adopt the same stance.</p>
<p>&quot;Some nuclear powers stubbornly uphold policies of nuclear deterrence based on first use of nuclear weapons,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>China held on July 29 what it said would be its last nuclear test before a self-imposed moratorium that took effect the following day. China was the last declared nuclear power to announce a halt to testing.</p>
