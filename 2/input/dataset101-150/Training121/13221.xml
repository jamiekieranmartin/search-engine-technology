<p>Taiwan on Sunday dismissed China's stern objections to the sale of 1,299 U.S.-made Stinger missiles to the island, saying the deal should present no problems.</p>
<p>&quot;These (the Stingers) are ordinary defensive weapons...there should be no problem in the deal,&quot; a military spokesman quoted the island's Defence Minister, Chiang Chung-ling, as saying.</p>
<p>Rejecting a demand by China, the U.S. Defence Department notified Congress on Friday of plans to sell Stinger missiles, launchers and other equipment to Taiwan.</p>
<p>&quot;The sale of this equipment will not affect the basic military balance in the region,&quot; the Pentagon told Congress.</p>
<p>The Pentagon said Taiwan wanted to buy 1,299 Stinger missiles, 74 guided missile launchers, 74 flight trainer Stinger missiles, 96 Humvee vehicles and 500 rounds of .50 calibre ammunition for an estimated $420 million.</p>
<p>Taiwan newspapers quoted Jason Hu, Taiwan's representative in the United States, as saying the sale was &quot;within our expectation&quot;.</p>
<p>China had demanded on August 15 that the sale be cancelled, saying the United States had made a &quot;solemn commitment to China on the question of selling weapons to Taiwan&quot;.</p>
<p>China, which has regarded Taiwan as a renegade province after a civil war split them in 1949, strongly objects to military links between Taiwan and foreign countries.</p>
<p>China threatens to recover Taiwan by force if it declares independence. Taiwan says it wants reunification instead of independence, but only after China becomes democratic.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Beijing carried out a series of war games in waters off Taiwan intended to intimidate voters in the run-up to Taiwan's first-ever presidential election.</p>
