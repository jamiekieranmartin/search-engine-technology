<p>China told the United States on Sunday to step back from tough action in a dispute over illegal transshipments of Chinese textiles, saying if Washington cut textile import quotas it risked hurting overall trade ties.</p>
<p>&quot;Chinese officials and textiles exporters are urging the United States to withdraw its decision to slash export quotas on Chinese textiles,&quot; the official China Daily Business Weekly said in a front page article.</p>
<p>&quot;Such a practice is unfair and could affect not only Chinese textile exports but (also) overall Sino-U.S. trade ties,&quot; the newspaper said.</p>
<p>Washington earlier this month announced punitive charges against China's 1996 textile and apparel quotas, citing Chinese textile transshipments in violation of a 1994 trade agreement.</p>
<p>An investigation by the U.S. Customs Service accused China of working aggressively to circumvent the agreement.</p>
<p>Beijing has denied the allegation and urged the United States to rescind the punitive action, which is expected to cost China about $19 million, or risk retaliatory action.</p>
<p>The U.S. charges were unacceptable and Washington had failed to provide clear evidence of the alleged transshipments, the Business Weekly quoted Li Dongsheng, a department head at the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, as saying.</p>
<p>Innocent Chinese exporters should not be blamed when foreign businessmen carried out illegal shipments to the United States, he said.</p>
<p>Washington's moves to limit Chinese textile imports carried a strong tint of trade protectionism and U.S. textiles importers and consumers were likely to suffer, the newspaper quoted officials of the China National Textile Council as saying.</p>
<p>In February 1995 and in June this year, Beijing and Washington narrowly avoided what would have been multibillion dollar trade wars over widespread copyright piracy in China.</p>
<p>Both sides say ties have warmed in recent months, helped by a string of high-level meetings.</p>
