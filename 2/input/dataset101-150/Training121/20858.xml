<p>A Chinese telecommunications satellite company will use a Long March rocket to launch a telecommunications satellite in late 1997, the official China Daily said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The announcement comes less than two weeks after a Long March series rocket placed $120 million Chinese satellite in the wrong orbit, leaving it drifting hopelessly in space.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no plan to switch to other rocket carriers,&quot; the newspaper quoted Hao Weimin, president of China Orient Telecommunications Satellite Co Ltd, as saying.</p>
<p>China Orient had signed a deal with China Great Wall Industry Corp to put the CHINASTAR-1 satellite into orbit between September and November next year, Hao said, adding that a final launch date had yet to be set.</p>
<p>The satellite, which China Orient bought from Lockheed Martin Corp of the United States, will carry 48 Ku-band transponders and would provide telecommunications service to China and southern and western Asia, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>China's space industry has been plagued by a recent string of failures.</p>
<p>On August 18, a Long March 3 rocket failed to place the U.S.-made Chinasat-7 telecommunications satellite in its proper orbit. The cause of the failure is still under investigation.</p>
<p>In February, the launch of a Long March 3B rocket ended in disaster when it blew up seconds after liftoff, showery fiery debris over a wide area killing six people, injuring 57 and destroying an Intelsat satellite.</p>
<p>In January 1995, a Long March carrier exploded, destroying the Apstar 2 satellite, also killing six people.</p>
