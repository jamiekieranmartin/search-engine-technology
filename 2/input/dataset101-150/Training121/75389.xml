<p>Taiwan said on Wednesday that the anti-missile Patriot and anti-aircraft Avenger missiles it had bought from the United States would enter service in 1999, boosting the island's defences against its giant rival China.</p>
<p>&quot;As communist China still seeks to take us, we must prepare for the danger in times of peace,&quot; Defence Minister Chiang Chung-ling said in his annual administrative report to the Legislative Yuan, or parliament.</p>
<p>&quot;The anti-air Patriots and Avengers are expected to enter service in 1999,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The United States said in 1993 that Taiwan planned a private purchase from U.S. defence giant Raytheon Co of a &quot;Modified Air Defence System&quot; based on the Gulf War-tested Patriot anti-missile missile.</p>
<p>Washington said in August that Taiwan's request to purchase the Avenger was being processed.</p>
<p>China, which has regarded Taiwan as a renegade province since the Chinese civil war split them in 1949, has angrily protested at the sales, of which the numbers of missiles were not disclosed.</p>
<p>Despite switching diplomatic recognition to Beijing from Taipei in 1979, Washington reserves the right to provide Taiwan with defensive weapons.</p>
<p>China threatens to recover Taiwan by force if it seeks independence. Taipei says it wants reunification, but only after China becomes democratic.</p>
<p>Angered by President Lee Teng-hui's private U.S. visit in mid-1995, Beijing mounted a series of intimidating war games and missile tests in waters near Taiwan until early 1996 to warn the island's people not to drop their reunification pledge.</p>
<p>&quot;That (the war games) shows its unfriendliness and that its threats of force toward us still exist,&quot; Chiang said.</p>
<p>Chiang said Taiwan must speed up the renewal of its weapons and raise the quality of its military personnel so that China &quot;dare not start a war hastily.&quot;</p>
<p>Under the Defence Ministry's plan, Taiwan will conduct 13 major exercises and training projects, which Chiang described as routine practice, in the July 1996/June 1997 fiscal year to train its soldiers and examine new weapons.</p>
<p>Taiwan has had problems buying advanced weapons from the West under pressure from China, but mobilised its economic clout in 1992 to buy 150 F-16 fighters from Washington and 60 Mirage 2000 fighters from Paris.</p>
<p>Taiwan took delivery of the first F-16s and Mirages in 1996 and &quot;attack helicopters and M60A3 tanks bought from abroad have started to arrive,&quot; Chiang said in the report.</p>
<p>Facing China's own rapid military modernisation, Taiwan has been actively strengthening its defences through foreign weapon purchases and the design and production of its own missiles and fighters.</p>
