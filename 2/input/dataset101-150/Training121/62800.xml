<title>TAIWAN: Taiwan denies anti-missile system plan with U.S..</title>

<p>Defence Minister Chiang Ching-ling on Wednesday denied a newspaper report that Taiwan and the United States were evaluating possible deployment of a joint anti-missile system on the island.</p>
<p>&quot;What the newspaper said is not correct,&quot; Chiang said on state-funded television.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no such thing. It's just a newspaper report,&quot; Chiang told reporters when asked about the report.</p>
<p>The United Daily News, quoting unnamed generals, said the system, which also would protect Japan and South Korea, was discussed at a secret meeting in early September.</p>
<p>Officials routinely deny reports about Taiwan weapons development and military contacts with foreign countries.</p>
<p>The latest report could not be confirmed independently and it was not known if it was related to Taiwan's planned purchase of U.S.-made anti-missile missiles.</p>
<p>The mass-circulation United Daily News said planning for the missile defence system was sparked by a series of intimidating military manoeuvres mounted by arch-rival China since mid-1995.</p>
<p>&quot;Both the U.S. side and we feel the emergent need to establish an anti-missile system after communist China's two rounds of missile tests targeting Taiwan last year and this year,&quot; the newspaper quoted the generals as saying.</p>
<p>The report did not say where the meeting was held or whether concrete conclusions were reached.</p>
<p>China launched a nine-month series of war games and missile tests off Taiwan after President Lee Teng-hui's private but high-profile visit to the United States in June 1995.</p>
<p>Beijing has regarded Taiwan as a renegade province not entitled to foreign ties since a civil war split them in 1949.</p>
<p>China's missile tests prompted Washington to send two aircraft carriers near the Taiwan strait to monitor the crisis during Taiwan's March presidential election.</p>
<p>Beijing maintains a standing threat to recover the island by force if it opts for independence. Both governments say they want reunification, but under very different terms.</p>
<p>Under pressure from China, Taiwan has faced difficulties in purchasing advanced weapons from the West but the United States, which switched diplomatic recognition to Beijing from Taipei in 1979, asserts a right to provide the island defensive weapons.</p>
<p>In 1993 Washington said Taiwan planned a private purchase from U.S. defence giant Raytheon Co. of a &quot;modified air defence system&quot; based on the Gulf War-tested Patriot anti-missile missile in a deal estimated at $175 million.</p>
