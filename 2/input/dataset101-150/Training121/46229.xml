<headline>China says nuclear test ban pact is welcome move.</headline>

<p>China on Wednesday welcomed the nuclear test ban treaty passed by the United Nations, and took the rare step of urging worldwide accession to the pact.</p>
<p>&quot;This move will surely contribute to the advancement of the nuclear disarmament process, the prevention of nuclear weapons proliferation and promotion of international peace and security,&quot; Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang told the official Xinhua news agency.</p>
<p>&quot;This undoubtedly conforms to the common interests of the entire international community,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The General Assembly overwhelmingly endorsed the treaty banning nuclear explosions in the atmosphere, underground or in any other environment, in a 158-to-three vote on Tuesday led by Australia and adamantly opposed by India.</p>
<p>Beijing, which usually avoids pressing other countries to take part in international accords, took the rare step of hinting that India should end its opposition.</p>
<p>China hoped the treaty would be signed as soon as possible and would be &quot;acceded to and honoured worldwide,&quot; Shen said, in a clear call to India.</p>
<p>India has dug in its heels, saying it would hold fast against the accord just as the nation's spiritual founder, Mahatma Gandhi, had stood up to British rule.</p>
<p>However, Shen repeated a long-held stand by China -- one of the world's five declared nuclear powers -- that the treaty was insufficient and that a total world ban on nuclear weapons was necessary.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course, the prohibition of nuclear testing is in itself not the ultimate objective, but rather the first step toward the accomplishment of the final goal of the complete elimination of nuclear weapons,&quot; Shen said.</p>
<p>&quot;Therefore, in the field of nuclear disarmament, the international community still has an arduous task and a long way to go,&quot; he said, adding that it should strive for a world free of nuclear weapons as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Removal of China's objections to the treaty had been crucial in reaching the final draft approved at the U.N.</p>
<p>Beijing has pledged support for the pact since reaching a deal with the United States that made international inspections of nuclear sites more difficult than in earlier drafts.</p>
<p>On July 29, China conducted what it said would be its last nuclear test before a self-imposed moratorium that took effect the following day. It was the last declared nuclear power after Britain, the United States, Russia and France to announce a halt to testing.</p>
<p>Three other non-declared nuclear states are believed to have covert nuclear programmes -- India, Pakistan and Israel.</p>
<p>India's opposition, based on the treaty's failure to set a timetable for eliminating the world's atomic arsenals, was a key sticking point for the deal's ultimate success and was likely to lead to heavy pressure on New Delhi.</p>
<p>The pact, known as the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), does not enter into force until 44 countries with nuclear power reactors sign the document and ratify it through their parliaments.</p>
