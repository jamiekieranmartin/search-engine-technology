<p>China on Tuesday expressed grave concern and deep regret over cruise missile attacks on Iraqi targets by the United States.</p>
<p>&quot;We express grave concern over U.S. air attacks on Iraqi air defence targets,&quot; state radio quoted Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang as saying.</p>
<p>&quot;We deeply regret new tensions arising in the Gulf,&quot; Shen said. &quot;We have always been against resorting to military force or mutual threats to resolve international incidents.&quot;</p>
<p>Shen urged the United States and Iraq to practise &quot;restraint to prevent the situation in the Gulf from worsening,&quot; the radio said.</p>
<p>Hours earlier, at a regular foreign ministry briefing, Shen had urged restraint on all sides and said the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Iraq should be respected.</p>
<p>&quot;We hope all sides will not take action that could further intensify the situation in that area,&quot; Shen told the briefing.</p>
<p>The U.S. military on Tuesday launched cruise missiles at air defence targets in southern Iraq in retaliation for Iraqi military attacks against Kurdish groups in the country's north, the Pentagon said.</p>
<p>China, a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, has in the past supported moves to ease restrictions on exports of Iraqi oil imposed shortly after Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990.</p>
<p>Sino-U.S. ties have been strained in recent years by disputes over China's arch-rival Taiwan, alleged human rights abuses and nuclear proliferation by Beijing and widespread copyright piracy on the mainland.</p>
