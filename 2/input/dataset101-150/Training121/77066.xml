<p>Beijing indicated on Wednesday that all was forgiven in its row with Bonn over Tibet by inviting the German president and renewing an invitation to Germany's foreign minister to visit China.</p>
<p>German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel had planned to visit China in July, but Beijing withdrew its invitation after the German lower house of parliament passed a resolution accusing China of trying to eradicate Tibet's cultural identity.</p>
<p>Beijing is embroiled in a separate row with Canberra over Tibet's exiled spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, visiting Australia and meeting government leaders.</p>
<p>Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen renewed the invitation to Kinkel on Tuesday after the two met at UN General Assembly in New York,  the official Xinhua news agency said.</p>
<p>&quot;The Chinese side expressed welcome to German President Roman Herzog to visit China...and welcomed Foreign Minister Kinkel to visit China beforehand,&quot; Xinhua said without elaborating.</p>
<p>Herzog's visit had been planned for this autumn.</p>
<p>Analysts said the renewed invitation indicated the row was now history. &quot;China's squabble with Germany over Tibet is over,&quot; a retired Chinese diplomat said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is not in China's interest to have too many squabbles with too many diplomatic partners at the same time,&quot; a Beijing-based Western diplomat said in reference to China's ongoing spat with Australia.</p>
<p>In Bonn, a Foreign Ministry statement said Kinkel had underlined the German government position that Tibet was part of the Chinese state and that Bonn had no intention of interfering in what it regarded as an internal matter.</p>
<p>The parliamentary resolution, which prompted Beijing to freeze high-level contacts with Bonn in June, had been introduced by the major parties rather than the government.</p>
<p>Xinhua said Qian and Kinkel had agreed to make every effort to expand Sino-German relations.</p>
<p>Although differences existed on human rights, they should be ironed out through dialogue rather than confrontation, it said.</p>
<p>China often sees support for Tibetan interests or for the Dalai Lama as implicit support for Tibetan independence.</p>
<p>Australian Prime Minister John Howard, defying Chinese threats of trade retaliation, has agreed to meet Tibet's exiled spiritual leader in Sydney on Thursday.</p>
<p>China's propaganda machine on Tuesday heaped accused the Dalai Lama of being a pawn of anti-Beijing forces.</p>
<p>Commenting on the meeting, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang said Australia was interfering in China's internal affairs by hosting the Dalai Lama, and that this would affect political as well as trade ties.</p>
<p>The Tibetan god-king, who fled his Himalayan homeland after an abortive uprising against Chinese rule in 1959, is seeking international pressure to force Beijing to open negotiations on autonomy for the vast but sparsely populated region.</p>
<p>The Dalai Lama, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989, has also visited the United States, Japan and New Zealand this year.</p>
<p>China has been accused of widespread human rights abuses since its troops invaded Tibet in 1950. Beijing denies the charge.</p>
