<headline>U.S., China hail improvement in ties.</headline>

<p>U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen met on Wednesday, both hailing a significant improvement in long-tense Sino-U.S. relations.</p>
<p>Christopher, noting it was their third meeting in the last five months, said the frequent encounters &quot;seem to me to have paid off in the marked improvement in our ties in recent months.&quot;</p>
<p>Qian, appearing with Christopher at a brief news conference before their meeting on the fringes of a U.N. General Assembly session, agreed that there had been &quot;positive progress&quot; and that the atmosphere had &quot;improved significantly.&quot;</p>
<p>Only six months ago the two nuclear powers were at loggerheads over Taiwan, Chinese sales of nuclear technology to Pakistan and piracy by Chinese companies of U.S. electronic products such as compact disks and computer software.</p>
<p>But Qian noted that since then, the dispute over the export of ring magnets -- used in making nuclear weapons -- had been resolved, intellectual property rights agreements had been reached and the United States had decided to renew trading privileges for China.</p>
<p>Christopher also singled out the intellectual property accords, although he said it was &quot;critically important that China implement these new agreements.&quot;</p>
<p>Qian said remaining problems included Taiwan, although tensions which reached a peak last March during presidential elections on the island -- considered a renegade province by Beijing -- have abated.</p>
<p>Christopher said Wednesday's talks would address differences over human rights, where Washington sees little improvement in China. The State Department recently raised two separate cases of imprisoned dissidents.</p>
<p>Qian dodged a question over Beijing's approach to the election of a U.N. secretary-general at the end of this year. China supports the re-election of Boutros Boutros-Ghali but Washington says it will not allow him to serve another term.</p>
<p>The Chinese minister said Beijing was satisfied with Boutros-Ghali, but was waiting to hear the views of the Organisation of African Unity.</p>
<p>If Boutros-Ghali, an Egyptian, cannot be re-elected, first priority in finding a successor is expected to be given to another candidate from the African continent.</p>
