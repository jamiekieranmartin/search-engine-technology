<p>Pakistan on Monday denied a U.S. newspaper report that said it was building a missile plant in Rawalpindi, near Islamabad, with Chinese help.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a figment of the unlimited imagination of the Washington Post, which is in the habit of breaking such stories in the past which have proved incorrect, false and malicious,&quot; Foreign Minister Assef Ahmad Ali told reporters. &quot;This is another false and malicious story,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;No such factory is working and we are not replicating any missiles with the help of any other country,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>However, the foreign minister said Pakistan would do whatever it felt necessary to defend itself. &quot;Let me clearly put it on record that Pakistan reserves the right to develop anything for its defence with its own resources,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The Washington Post reported on Sunday that U.S. intelligence officials had concluded that Pakistan was secretly building a medium-range missile factory in a suburb of the northern city of Rawalpindi.</p>
<p>China has denied any role in the reported project. &quot;The U.S. newspaper report is entirely groundless,&quot; a Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said in Beijing on Monday.</p>
<p>The Washington Post said that the development raised the prospect of a new Sino-U.S. dispute over arms proliferation.</p>
<p>It said the partially completed plant was expected to be capable of producing most of the major components of a missile modeled on the Chinese-designed M-11 in a year or two.</p>
<p>Some U.S. officials believed the factory would produce precise duplicates of the missile, the paper said.</p>
<p>A White House spokesman said he could not confirm the story but said the United States took such reports seriously.</p>
<p>&quot;We do not believe it is in the best interests of the United States or of any other country to supply Pakistan with the capacity to manufacture or deploy weapons of mass destruction,&quot; the spokesman said.</p>
<p>The United States has twice imposed limited economic sanctions against China for selling M-11 missile launchers and finished missile components to Pakistan, but withdrew the curbs after Beijing promised to stop such deliveries.</p>
<p>Washington halted aid to Pakistan in 1990 over suspicion of its nuclear programme. It eased sanctions this year, deciding to deliver $368 million worth of blocked military equipment, but not 28 F-16 fighter planes Islamabad had paid for.</p>
<p>The first shipment of the released equipment arrived in Karachi port earlier on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;This event is not only a harbinger of a new phase of strengthening Pakistani-U.S. relations but also a vindication of the present government's successful foreign policy&quot;, Defence Minister Aftab Shaaban Meerani said in Karachi.</p>
