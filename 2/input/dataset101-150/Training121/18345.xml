<p>China should stop approving new foreign-funded bicycle producers to ease an oversupply in the domestic market, official media said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>It should also reorganise existing firms and punish those using unfair competitive practices, it said.</p>
<p>&quot;The overexpansion of foreign-funded firms in some regions and industries is worrying,&quot; the Market Daily said in a front-page editoral.</p>
<p>&quot;To avoid an oversupply of foreign-funded firms, macro-control should be strengthened,&quot; the newspaper said.</p>
<p>&quot;Authorities should stop approving new foreign-funded bicycle firms and reorganise existing ones and close those that are not qualified. Firms engaged in unfair competition should be punished,&quot; it said, quoting industry specialists.</p>
<p>It gave no examples of unfair practices.</p>
<p>Annual demand for bicycles in China was about 30 million, the newspaper said. But China's bicycle production capacity increased sharply due to rapid inflow of foreign investment into the industry during the past several years.</p>
<p>&quot;Current production capacity could have hit 60-70 million bicycles due to the expansion by foreign firms,&quot; the newspaper said.</p>
<p>Of China's 300 bicycle producers, 60 are foreign-invested, it said. Production capacity of foreign-funded makers has exceeded 15 million.</p>
<p>Industry officials said that stockpiles of unsold bicycles were rising.</p>
<p>Adding to the problem was a slump in exports. China exported 5.88 million bicycles in the first seven months, down 14.6 percent, customs figures showed.</p>
<p>Some of the output initially for the export market has now found its way onto the domestic market. About 70 percent of the nation's major bicycle producers were loss-making.</p>
<p>China's two biggest bicycle producers reported disappointing first half results. Net profits of the Shanghai Phoenix Co, the biggest producer, plunged 79.48 pct year-on-year to 7.227 million yuan ($870,722) in the first-half.</p>
<p>Net profits of Shanghai Forever Bicycle Co, the second largest producer, fell 74.74 percent to 2.369 million yuan.</p>
<p>$= 8.3 yuan</p>
