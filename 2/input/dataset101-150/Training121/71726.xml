<p>Beijing is walking a diplomatic tightrope in a row with Tokyo over a group of disputed islands in the East China Sea in part because Japan is a major aid donor, trading partner and investor, analysts said.</p>
<p>China, which has fanned the flames of nationalism in recent months to fill an ideological vacuum, has thwarted any attempts to stage street protests, fearing nationalistic sentiment could careen out of control, Chinese and Western analysts said.</p>
<p>While China does not want to be perceived as weak or unpatriotic, it faces the challenge of avoiding too many squabbles with too many diplomatic partners at the same time.</p>
<p>&quot;The breadth and depth of the economic relationship between China and Japan ... compels the Chinese government to exercise some restraint on this issue,&quot; a Western diplomat said of the dispute over the islands -- known as the Diaoyus in Chinese and the Senkakus in Japanese.</p>
<p>Tokyo has agreed to grant $5.27 billion in low-interest loans to Beijing over a three-year period from April, making it difficult for China to bite the hand that helps feed it.</p>
<p>A dispute flared this month when Japanese rightists sailed to the uninhabited islands and repaired a makeshift aluminium lighthouse damaged by a typhoon last month to buttress Tokyo's claim over them.</p>
<p>Japan effectively supported the rightists by sending patrol boats to repel private vessels from rival claimant Taiwan that tried to approach the islands, touching off anti-Japanese sentiment in China, Taiwan and the British colony of Hong Kong, which is due to revert to Chinese rule in mid-1997.</p>
<p>Beijing and Taipei, rivals since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949, agree the Diaoyus have been China's for centuries and dispute Tokyo's claim, which dates to 1895 when Japan defeated imperial China in a war and seized the Diaoyus.</p>
<p>Many Chinese have been slow to forgive and forget Japan's 1931-45 invasion of China. By Beijing's count, 35 million Chinese died under Japanese occupation.</p>
<p>Attempts by Japanese politicians to whitewash Japan's atrocities and Tokyo allowing the rightists to reassert its sovereignty over the islands have only added insult to injury.</p>
<p>The issue has ignited anger among ethnic Chinese in many places and a protest ship set sail on Sunday for the islands from Hong Kong</p>
<p>In the face of growing anti-Japanese sentiment, Tokyo has called for calm.</p>
<p>China has no plans to take on Japan head on.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not in China's interests to have too many major disputes going at the same time with too many of its diplomatic partners,&quot; an Asian diplomat said.</p>
<p>Beijing and Washington have squabbled in recent years over Taiwan, human rights, trade and alleged nuclear proliferation.</p>
<p>&quot;If we go to war against Japan, we will fall into the trap of the United States,&quot; a retired Chinese diplomat said of calls for China to send warships to the islands.</p>
<p>Some U.S. officials and media have portrayed China as the evil empire that could become a threat to world peace. China vehemently denies this.</p>
<p>A Chinese official who spoke on condition of anonymity said China was as eager as Japan to put the dispute behind them.</p>
<p>China has shunted to remote regions zealous anti-Japanese activists who planned to stage protests outside the Japanese embassy in Beijing.</p>
<p>Beijing has difficulty understanding why Tokyo cannot rein in its right-wing groups.</p>
<p>Also, Chinese education authorities have pacified Beijing's embattled students and stopped them from taking to the streets, fearing behind-the-scenes &quot;black hands&quot; could manipulate demonstrations, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;China does not want to encourage ... demonstrations because they would have the potential to careen out of control,&quot; the Western diplomat said.</p>
<p>Student-led demonstrations for democracy in 1989 ended with soldiers opening fire on protesters, tanks rolling in and heavy loss of life. China blamed the protests on &quot;black hands&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Nationalism is the (ruling) Communist Party's weapon. But China must be careful not to cut itself,&quot; said a Chinese analyst who requested anonymity.</p>
