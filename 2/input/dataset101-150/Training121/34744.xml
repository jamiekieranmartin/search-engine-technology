<title>CHINA: China not a military threat - Beijing.</title>

<p>China's defense minister, Chi Haotian, on Thursday said the idea of a militarily aggressive China was &quot;sheer nonsense,&quot; and that he saw dialogue with the United States as essential for regional peace.</p>
<p>&quot;The maintenance of friendly relations between China and the U.S. is of significance not only for the Asia-Pacific region but the whole world,&quot; China's official Xinhua news agency quoted Chi as saying.</p>
<p>Chi told Admiral Joseph Prueher, commander of the U.S. Pacific Command, in a meeting in Beijing that the theories of a &quot;China threat&quot; were &quot;sheer nonsense,&quot; Xinhua said.</p>
<p>&quot;Contact is better than containment, and dialogue is better than confrontation,&quot; Chi said. In Cold War parlance, &quot;containment&quot; meant restricting the spread of communism.</p>
<p>Chi, who has been invited to visit the United States, said he hoped a recent warming of Sino-U.S. relations would continue and that the issue of Taiwan would be the focal point of ties between Washington and Beijing.</p>
<p>Relations between the two Pacific giants plunged in March when China conducted missile tests off the coast of Taiwan in the run-up to the island's first direct presidential elections.</p>
<p>Washington responded by sending two aircraft carrier battle groups to the region in a show of support for Taiwan.</p>
<p>Beijing has regarded Taiwan as a rebel province since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949, and has sought to push the island into diplomatic isolation.</p>
<p>Prueher said the United States did not see China as a threat and that prosperity in China was in the interests of Washington.</p>
