<p>Former U.S. president George Bush called on Thursday for an end to U.S. trade threats against China, saying more dialogue was needed between Washington and Beijing to mend cross-Pacific ties.</p>
<p>The United States should give China permanent Most Favoured Nation (MFN) trade status to end the annual diplomatic battle over its renewal, Bush said in a speech at a seminar in Beijing.</p>
<p>&quot;I am very concerned about the rancour that sometimes rears its head these days,&quot; he said. &quot;There is too much China-bashing in the United States of America.&quot;</p>
<p>Some members of the U.S. Congress had little understanding of China and how to deal with Beijing, Bush said.</p>
<p>&quot;Threatening China does not work,&quot; he said. &quot;It might be good domestic politics in some quarters of the United States, but it does not bring about change, and it ought to stop.&quot;</p>
<p>Relations between Washington and Beijing have been badly strained this year by disputes over trade, copyright theft, nuclear proliferation and Taiwan.</p>
<p>Washington needs a strategic dialogue with Beijing to iron out differences before they become major disputes and to help stabilise a bilateral relationship that was of unsurpassed importance, Bush said.</p>
<p>&quot;We can start by granting permanent, unconditional MFN for China,&quot; he told the Chinese and U.S. businessmen and officials in a speech salted with nostalgic references to his experiences as a diplomat in Beijing during the 1970s.</p>
<p>MFN give favourable tariff treatment to Chinese goods imported into the U.S.</p>
<p>Sino-U.S. ties chilled in March when Chinese missile tests off the coast of rival Taiwan led Washigton to send two aircraft carrier battle groups into the area in a show of force.</p>
<p>In June, the two sides narrowly averted a multi-billion dollar trade war over intellectual property theft in China, while alleged sales of Chinese nuclear technology to Pakistan and Beijing's fat U.S. trade surplus have also strained ties.</p>
<p>Both sides say relations have warmed in the last few months but Bush said more was needed, advising Beijing to value the contribution of U.S. businessmen in China -- a group that has long campaigned for better ties and permanent MFN.</p>
<p>&quot;American business is China's best ally in reducing the misunderstanding and suspicions that cloud our relationship from time to time,&quot; Bush said.</p>
