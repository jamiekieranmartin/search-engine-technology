<p>One of China's top generals has warned that the United States has more to lose than it would stand to gain by flirting with Beijing's diplomatic rival, Taiwan.</p>
<p>&quot;We hope the United States...will not create trouble again on the Taiwan issue,&quot; the official People's Daily on Saturday quoted General Zhang Wannian, vice-chairman of the powerful Central Military Commission, as saying.</p>
<p>Washington stood &quot;to lose a lot by gaining a little&quot; on the Taiwan issue and should put Sino-U.S. interests above everything else, Zhang was quoted as telling former U.S. defence secretary James Schlesinger in Beijing on Friday.</p>
<p>See-sawing Sino-U.S. ties were severely strained by a row over a landmark trip by Taiwan's President Lee Teng-hui to the United States in June 1995.</p>
<p>Beijing has regarded Taiwan as a rebel province since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949 and sought to push the island into isolation. Washington switched diplomatic recognition to Beijing from Taipei in 1979.</p>
<p>China conducted intimidatory war games and missile tests off Taiwan in the run-up to the island's first direct presidential elections, which Lee won, in March.</p>
<p>The United States responded by sending aircraft carrier battle groups to the region in a show of support for Taiwan.</p>
<p>Sino-U.S. ties have improved since the military exercises, and China's leaders have taken great pains in recent months to remind the United Sates not to flirt with Taiwan again.</p>
<p>Zhang said smooth Sino-U.S. ties meant a lot to Beijing.</p>
<p>&quot;We are willing to endeavour with the United States to improve trust, reduce troubles, develop cooperation and not engage in confrontation,&quot; Zhang said.</p>
<p>&quot;The maintenance and development of healthy and stable Sino-U.S. ties is conducive not only to the interests of the peoples of the two countries but also to peace and stability in Asia and the world,&quot; Zhang said.</p>
<p>Zhang dismissed the idea of a militarily aggressive China as mere speculation intended to  &quot;make trouble out of nothing&quot; and sow discord between China and its neighbours.</p>
<p>He said China posed no threat to other countries, saying its military policy was defensive in nature and that its defence spending was relatively modest.</p>
<p>Ties between Beijing and Washington moved onto a better footing after a visit to Beijing by U.S. National Security Adviser Anthony Lake in July.</p>
<p>The visit laid the groundwork for an exchange of high-level visits later in the year, with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher invited to visit China in November and Chinese Defence Minister Chi Haotian due to go to Washington before the end of December.</p>
<p>An exchange of visits by China's President Jiang Zemin and his U.S. counterpart, Bill Clinton, could go ahead next year, if Clinton is re-elected in the presidential poll in November.</p>
<p>Chinese officials have said they expect Christopher's visit, his first since a 1994 trip that stumbled badly on human rights issues, to go smoothly with both sides keen to remove obstacles any obstacles in the way of good relations.</p>
