<p>A wave of nationalism sweeping China is a reaction to pressure from the United States and does not reflect an anti-foreign policy by Beijing, a prominent Chinese journal has said.</p>
<p>Outlook magazine, in a commentary in its latest edition, said the United States was fearful of China's growth and had tried to hinder its development with economic sanctions.</p>
<p>The United States wanted to Westernise and split China, it said.</p>
<p>&quot;It doesn't acknowledge this, but the Chinese people can see it all too clearly,&quot; the commentary said.</p>
<p>&quot;Opinion polls indicate that the number of young people who despise the United States is rising rapidly,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>&quot;Where does this sentiment among young people come from? It comes from American pressure, it comes from the American government's mistaken policy towards China,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>China's ambitious programme of economic reform has eroded Marxist values. Western scholars and Chinese critics have said that the ruling Communist Party is now trying to use nationalism to fill the void.</p>
<p>The journal slammed Washington for sending warships near Taiwan earlier this year while Beijing test-fired unarmed missiles off the island's coast.</p>
<p>&quot;(This) interfered in China's internal affairs,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>It also accused the United States of colluding with anti-China dissidents and activists.</p>
<p>&quot;It is this kind of high-handedness and presumptuousness that has aroused the patriotic feelings of the Chinese people,&quot; it said.</p>
