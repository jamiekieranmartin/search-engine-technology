<p>Australian archaeologists have found aboriginal stone tools and rock art they claim date back more than 116,000 years and could support suggestions that modern humans orginated in Asia, not Africa.</p>
<p>Research team leader Richard Fullagar said on Saturday the stone chips found at a dig in Australia's remote northwest showed humans lived there between 116,000 and 176,000 years ago, around the time of the emergence of modern human form in Africa.</p>
<p>&quot;The initial samples were taken four to five years ago now, and we were so shocked with the results that we have been trying to go over them and trying to disprove these things, and we can't do that,&quot; Fullagar said in a radio interview.</p>
<p>The artefacts dramatically push back the earliest human occupation of Australia and roughly coincide with the emergence of homo sapiens in Africa, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;This almost doubles the previous estimates of the age of aboriginal occupation on the continent,&quot; the four-member research team said in a statement issued on Saturday.</p>
<p>Australian Museum prehistorian Paul Tacon said on Saturday that the antiquity of the stone artefacts implied that either modern humans originated outside Africa or homo sapiens spread across the world more rapidly than currently presumed.</p>
<p>&quot;Some people have argued that perhaps modern humans originated somewhere in Southeast Asia and this could strengthen that argument,&quot; Tacon told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;What our findings do is raise the level of debate and general discussion of human origins. Perhaps humans developed in other parts of the world, or perhaps humans were spreading across the world much faster...,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Tacon estimated the first Australian Aborigines must have reached the continent from the direction of Asia by sea.</p>
<p>&quot;One of the reasons we think they were fully modern humans is that at the time...they would have had to have crossed at least 60 km (37 miles) of open water and that means they would have had to have built some sort of complex raft,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The discoveries, at a site dubbed &quot;Australia's Stonehenge&quot;, also include rock engravings dating back 58,000 to 75,000 years -- twice as old as French rock paintings traditionally felt to mark the beginnings of art, the team said.</p>
<p>&quot;The whole package is mind-blowing,&quot; Tacon said, describing the series of circular impressions as a form of rock sculpture.</p>
<p>Fullagar said some ochre, commonly used in aboriginal art, was found at a slightly higher level than the stone artefacts.</p>
<p>&quot;Up at the level which is around about 58,000 to 75,000 years ago, there is an (engraved) sandstone slab,&quot; Fullagar told Australian Broadcasting Corp. &quot;They are perhaps the oldest rock art anywhere in the world,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The age of the engravings was determined by dating the sediments in which they were found, the research team said.</p>
<p>&quot;There are engravings thought to be a couple of hundred thousand years old in Asia, but all the finds (there) are small and the dates are questionable. We have a very reliable date,&quot; Tacon said.</p>
<p>The team from the Australian Museum and University of Wollongong plan to publish their findings in British science journal &quot;Antiquity&quot; in December.</p>
