<p>THE AUSTRALIAN FINANCIAL REVIEW</p>
<p>In contrast to statements by Prime Minister Howard and other senior ministers, new Reserve Bank governor Ian Macfarlane said yesterday the government's proposed industrial relations reforms would have very little effect on employment and joblessnss in the short term. Macfarlane's comments followed criticism of the government's description of the fiscal position as a &quot;black hole&quot; by former Reserve Bank governor Bernie Fraser. Page 1.</p>

<p>The Law Institute yesterday gave overwhelming support to a proposal by Chief Justice of Australia, Gerard Brennan, which calls for greater use of cheaper and quicker methods of dispute resolution, such as mediation and arbitration, to clear the logjam of complex and lengthy trials in the courts.

<p>Launching a land access summary by the Bureau of Resource Sciences yesterday, Resources Minister Warwick Parer said the government was likely to allow mining and exploration in areas classified by the Australian Heritage Commission as having &quot;high wildernss value&quot;.

<p>THE AUSTRALIAN</p>
<p>A week after taking up the position of Reserve Bank governor, Ian McFarlane told the annual Conference of Economists in Canberra yesterday that the Government's industrial relations reforms would have little effect on employment in the short-term, with most of the effect being on productivity and long-run growth.

<p>Although Prime Minister John Howard last night defended the right of Independent MP Pauline Hanson to speak out on controversial issues, he rejected her views on Asian immigration, stating Australia has a non-discriminatory immigration policy. Howard also dismissed a challenge from right-wing British historian David Irving to overturn a ban by the former Labor Government on his entry to Australia, calling him a &quot;crackpot&quot; and an opportunist.

<p>Continuing a war of words with university vice-chancellors, Education Minister Amanda Vanstone yesterday ridiculed them for their fierce reaction to her comments which played down the impact of budget cuts on universities. Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee president Fay Gales said yesterday the minister had been &quot;completely wrong&quot; to suggest universities were afraid of change when all the evidence suggests the contrary.

<p>Following France's signing of a global nuclear test ban treaty yesterday, the federal government will consider lifting the eight-year-old ban on new uranium contracts with the nation, making way for a three to four-fold increase in Australian exports to France and an improvement in the battered relationship between the two countries.
