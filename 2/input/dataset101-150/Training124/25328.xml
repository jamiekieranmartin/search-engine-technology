<p>Australian Prime Minister John Howard said on Friday the Productivity Commission would inquire into the structure and conduct of the private health insurance industry.</p>
<p>&quot;The inquiry will be conducted against the background of the Coalition (government's) core election commitments to retain Medicare, bulk billing and community rating, and to provide financial incentives for families and individuals with private health insurance,&quot; Howard said in a statement.  </p>
<p>The Australian government announced in the budget last week it would implement tax incentives worth about A$500 million a year to encourage people to take out private health insurance and to wean rich people off the public Medicare health system.</p>
<p>But the Health Department meanwhile approved premium increases for two private health insurance funds, which the Opposition said would cancel the benefits of the incentives.</p>
<p>Howard said on Thursday that he, Treasurer Peter Costello and Health Minister Michael Wooldridge would determine applications for further rises.</p>
<p>Announcing the inquiry on Friday, Howard said it would review pressures on the industry, such as declining membership levels and increasing health care costs, and ensure contributors benefit from the government's private health incentives.</p>
<p>Another issue would be &quot;a regulatory regime that encourages the emergence of competitive products which cater for the varying needs of consumers whilst adhering to the community rating principle.&quot;</p>
<p>Community rating prevents the funds from differentiating between different risk categories among customers, such as the elderly.</p>
<p>The inquiry, to report by February 28, would also examine competition regulations and put in place a policy for setting financial reserves for the funds.</p>
