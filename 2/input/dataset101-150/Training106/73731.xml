<p>A World Bank official, praising Algeria's progress in stabilising its economy, wants the government to carry out a massive sell-off of state-owned firms through vouchers to lure small investors, an Algerian newspaper said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>World Bank regional director for the Maghreb, Daniel Ritchie, told Liberte newspaper the bank had several ways to support the government to implement reforms in the violence-ridden North African country.</p>
<p>He asked Algeria to speed up the sell-off of state-owned by &quot;popular privatisation through the technique of widescale selling-off by vouchers,&quot; Liberte said.</p>
<p>Ritchie gave examples of Algerian industry factories still operating despite no one buying their products.</p>
<p>&quot;Why this obstinacy to protect these jobs today at the cost of thousands of jobs which might be created tomorrow,&quot; he asked.</p>
<p>Outside Algeria's oil and gas industry, some 400 state firms are estimated overall to operate at only 35 percent capacity while an estimated 500 billion dinars ($9 billion) have been injected in them in the past seven years to try to save around 1.7 million jobs.</p>
<p>&quot;Algeria has made huge progress in macro-economic stabilisation. I have been told that you are heading to reach a three percent rate in creating jobs, a positive growth rate for the second consecutive year and, above all, a budget surplus&quot;, he said.</p>
<p>Ritchie visited Algeria this week where he held talks with economy officials and toured several industry plants to get first hand look into the country's reforms, officials said.</p>
<p>Algeria's economy ministers will meet International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank officials later this month in Washington to assess Algeria's reform record.</p>
<p>The government said this week industrial sector production slumped by seven percent in the first half of 1996 compared to the same period of 1995.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia said the industrial stagnation underlined the &quot;significance and the interest the country had to give to stabilise this important section of the economy.&quot;</p>
<p>Algeria posted a 4.4 percent growth in its Gross Domestic Product in the first half of 1996, a $1.3 billion trade surplus for the same period and has forecast a $300 million current account surplus for the whole year against a previous forecast $2 billion deficit.</p>
