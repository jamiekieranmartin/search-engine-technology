<p>A poll released on Friday but conducted before a reported sex scandal in Bill Clinton's inner circle showed the president would beat Bob Dole by 13 points if the election were held now.</p>
<p>The CNN/USA Today poll of 622 registered voters gave the Democratic president and his running-mate Al Gore 51 percent of the vote, compared with 38 percent for Republicans Dole and vice presidential nominee Jack Kemp.</p>
<p>Billionaire Ross Perot got 7 percent, with 4 percent undecided, according to the poll conducted Aug. 28-29, before reports that Clinton political strategist Dick Morris had a long-running relationship with a self-described prostitute.</p>
<p>The poll, conducted by the Gallup organisation, was completed before Clinton accepted his party's nomination at the Democratic Convention in Chicago late on Thursday.</p>
<p>The poll, which had a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points, showed Clinton had a 17-point lead in a two-way race with Dole, with 57 percent of the vote compared with 40 percent for Dole and 3 percent having no opinion.</p>
