<p>A long custody battle fought over a 6-year-old Albuquerque boy has been resolved with his adoptive parents and birth father agreeing to raise him jointly, officials said Friday.</p>
<p>New Mexico District Judge John Brennan decided this week that the natural father, who never gave up his parental rights, and the adoptive parents were entitled to equal access to the boy.</p>
<p>&quot;This landmark decision allows all adults to have a relationship with the child, albeit on a reduced basis,&quot; Brennan said. &quot;He needs all of them in his life.&quot;</p>
<p>The child currently spends most of his time with his adoptive parents, Kyle and Karla Roth, but arrangements are being made so he will spend half of the time with them and the other half with his natural father, John Bookert.</p>
<p>The Roths and Bookert will share in medical and educational decisions for the boy and agreed to resolve any conflicts that arise, turning to counsellors if necessary.</p>
<p>&quot;It's truly the adults putting their desires and wants second to the child's needs,&quot; said Michael Hart, an attorney for the Roths.</p>
<p>Bookert was separated from the boy's birth mother when she gave him up for adoption at nine months old. When an adoption agency called Bookert to see if he would give up his parental rights, he refused to do so and said he wanted full custody.</p>
<p>But the agency gave the boy to the Roth family anyway, and Bookert began his legal battle to gain custody in 1991.</p>
<p>The adoption agency was put on a one-year probation for its handling of the adoption and the boy's natural mother was given no visitation rights under the settlement.</p>
<p>In other similar custody cases surrounding adopted children, the courts have traditionally given custody to one or the other set of parents.</p>
