<p>A convicted British paedophile was arrested on Saturday, two days after escaping from custody during a supervised day trip to a zoo, police said.</p>
<p>Trevor Holland, a 52 year-old with who has been convicted twice of gross indecency with children, was captured after being spotted in Worthing, a town on England's southern coast.</p>
<p>&quot;A member of the public recognised Holland in a newsagent shop as he was reading the headlines about himself,&quot; a police spokesman said.</p>
<p>Police launched a nationwide search on Thursday after he disappeared during an unsupervised trip to the toilet while visiting a popular zoo and theme park south of London.</p>
<p>Holland was moved to a more secure centre earlier this year after a similar incident.</p>
<p>His escape at the zoo caused outrage in Britain.</p>
<p>A child sex scandal in Belgium in which two eight-year-old girls were murdered and two other sexually abused girls were rescued has focused new attention on the problem.</p>
