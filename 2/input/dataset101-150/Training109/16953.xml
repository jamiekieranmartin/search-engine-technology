<p>While a global child sex conference in Sweden and a Belgian paedophilia scandal grab headlines, a trial in Germany entered its 234th day on Tuesday, highlighting the legal nightmare of child abuse cases.</p>
<p>The three linked court cases in the city of Mainz are also making history as judges test the limits of legal practice in an attempt to solve Germany's biggest child abuse case.</p>
<p>Twenty four adults from two extended families in nearby Worms are variously charged with raping or sadistically torturing the two families' children, or hiring them out for others to abuse. Many acts are alleged to have been filmed.</p>
<p>The first case began in November 1994 and the others in April 1995. So far, with all the accused remaining silent and the court having to deal with all the legal obstacles and emotional trauma that go with pitting abused children against adults or parents, there is no sign when they will end.</p>
<p>&quot;The main problem is the whole issue of questioning children in court,&quot; said a spokesman for the Mainz prosecutor's office.</p>
<p>&quot;You put a child in front of a panel of black-robed judges in a forbidding court room, and it's frightened,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Then there are arguments between the lawyers about the evidence, and the child is even more uncomfortable.&quot;</p>
<p>In Worms, some children were only six months old at the time of the alleged abuse. Others refused to speak in court, even though parents and relatives accused of mistreating them were kept outside.</p>
<p>In addition, children's testimony may not be as reliable or lucid as that of adults, and leaves huge scope for defence and prosecution to bring in experts to evaluate it at length.</p>
<p>But in the absence of other evidence, convictions look impossible without testimony from the 16 children believed to have been abused in over 200 cases.</p>
<p>One 10-year-old boy who gave evidence in one of the cases was faced with doing it all over again in a parallel trial.</p>
<p>German law requires testimony in court to be &quot;direct&quot;. But faced with inflicting so much trauma on the boy again, the court agreed a new interpretation of the term.</p>
<p>The judge questioned him in an adjoining room, filled with children's toys. For the first time in German history, witness testimony was relayed to the courtroom by video.</p>
<p>The move, already common in some other countries, means there will almost certainly be an appeal to a higher court if convictions are secured.</p>
<p>But it has also galvanised German authorities to seek new ways of hearing evidence from children.</p>
<p>&quot;We are working on a number of concrete ideas to change the way children give evidence,&quot; said a justice ministry spokeswoman. &quot;The Mainz solution is not perfect as it doesn't allow the judge to see the reaction of the accused.&quot;</p>
<p>Other suggestions involve recording testimony and admitting it in other cases to avoid repeat questioning.</p>
<p>Investigation and questioning techniques are also changing to face the specific pitfalls of child abuse cases.</p>
<p>Three or four years ago, public awareness of child abuse prompted almost half of divorced couples contesting custody of their children to accuse partners of incest, said Siegfried Willutzki, chairman of the Family Judges' Association.</p>
<p>But the increased use of specially trained investigators and judges produced a sharp drop in such accusations, he said.</p>
