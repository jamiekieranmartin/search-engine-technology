<headline>House tucks child custody case into unrelated bill.</headline>

<p>The House passed a 1997 transportation spending bill on Wednesday that strips local courts of authority over a notorious child custody case involving Dr. Elizabeth Morgan.</p>
<p>Morgan, the subject of a movie and books, spent 25 months in jail in the late 1980's after refusing to comply with a judge's order to let her ex-husband, Dr. Eric Foretich, visit their daugher. Morgan accused Foretich, an oral surgeon, of sexually abusing the girl, a charge he hotly denies.</p>
<p>She was released from jail by a previous act of Congress. Her parents spirited their grandchild out of the country and Morgan and the child, now 14, have been living in New Zealand.</p>
<p>The transportation measure, which was sent to the Senate, removed the threat of further court action against Morgan, who has said she will not come back to the United States if there is a chance her ex-husband will be granted visitation rights.</p>
<p>Foretich has said he wants to keep the case under court oversight.</p>
<p>The controversial provision was tucked into the must-pass spending bill at the last-minute by Virginia Representative Frank Wolf, who argued the case had dragged on too long. He said Morgan, who recently had her colon removed, was ill and deserved to return. Her daughter has also said she wants to come back.</p>
<p>&quot;The legislation passes no judgment on any of the parties involved. It does not take sides. It does not say anyone is right or anyone is wrong,&quot; Wolf said. &quot;I was not elected to Congress to harm people, I was elected to Congress to help people and I have done what I believe was right.&quot;</p>
<p>Several lawmakers vehemently protested, calling the move an unconstitutional effort to strip the courts of power.</p>
<p>&quot;(Congress) has in effect legislated the outcome of a child custody case when the Congress doesn't have any of the facts, and that is outrageous,&quot; said Representative James Sensenbrenner, a Wisconsin Republican.</p>
<p>Fellow Virginia Republican Herb Bateman attacked Wolf's move saying, &quot;It is an abuse of the legislative process and shocks the conscience of this member.&quot;</p>
<p>The dustup was the only real point of contention as the House voted 395-19 for the $37.9 billion spending bill. The measure provided $1.3 billion more for Amtrak, federal highway and other transportation programmes than in fiscal 1996.</p>
<p>It was one in a package of 13 annual spending bills Congress rushed to approve before Oct. 1, the beginning of the new fiscal year, to keep the government running. Republican leaders admitted they will be unable to complete work on all the spending bills before October.</p>
<p>Eager to avoid a repeat of last winter's two unpopular partial government shutdowns, Republicans were working with the White House to craft one bill funding a host of government programmes and agencies.</p>
