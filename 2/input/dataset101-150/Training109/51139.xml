<p>An Israeli woman won the right on Thursday to try to become a mother using frozen embryos her estranged husband wanted destroyed.</p>
<p>Last year, a five-judge panel of the Supreme Court said Danny Nahmani, who fertilised 11 of his childless wife's eggs in vitro before their marriage went bad, could not be forced to become a father against his will.</p>
<p>An 11-judge panel overturned that ruling on Thursday, saying Ruti Nahmani's right to be a mother was paramount.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a big slap to a man's most intimate parts,&quot; Danny Nahmani's lawyer, Diana Har-Even, told reporters after the decision was announced.</p>
<p>Danny Nahmani, 37, fertilised the eggs between 1988 and 1990. Since leaving Ruti Nahmani in 1992, he has fathered two girls with another woman. Danny and Ruti Nahmani are still engaged in divorce proceedings.</p>
<p>Ruti Nahmani, 42, had a hysterectomy in 1987. She has said she plans to have the embryos implanted in a surrogate mother. Israel recently legalised surrogacy.</p>
<p>Legal experts said the decision was a landmark for Israel. The case has made headlines in Israel for years as the Nahmanis fought their way through the courts.</p>
<p>&quot;They have given me the best gift of my life,&quot; she said after the judges ruled 7-4 in her favour. &quot;Not being a mother hurts more than being a father to a child you might not want.&quot;</p>
<p>In its decision, the court agreed.</p>
<p>&quot;A woman's right to be a parent is stronger than a man's right not to be a father,&quot; it said.</p>
