<p>Jury selection began in  O.J. Simpson's civil trial on Wednesday with the judge and attorneys face a daunting challenge -- finding 12 jurors who haven't already made up their minds.</p>
<p>Simpson's murder trial was the most highly publicised courtroom drama in U.S. history, and his acquittal last October 3 in the killings of his ex-wife and her friend divided Americans sharply along racial lines.</p>
<p>Now the former football star faces wrongful-death civil lawsuits by the victims' families and it is hard to find anyone who hasn't already formed a strong opinion.</p>
<p>A group of about 100 prospective jurors were at the Santa Monica Superior Court on Wednesday morning to begin the screening process. Besides the 12 jurors, eight alternates will be chosen.</p>
<p>They filed into the courtroom in batches to be questioned by lawers for both Simpson and the families of the victims.</p>
<p>The makeup of the jury could be as crucial in the civil case as it was in the criminal trial, when the predominantly black panel in downtown Los Angeles found Simpson not guilty.</p>
<p>The civil trial is in the more affluent seaside town of Santa Monica, where the jury is more likely to reflect the white local population.</p>
<p>Nationwide polls consistently show most whites believe Simpson was guilty of murder, while most blacks support the not-guilty verdict.</p>
<p>Before jury selection, which is expected to take several days, Judge Hiroshi Fujisaki ruled on several motions from lawyers.</p>
<p>He ordered the autopsy photographs of Simpson's slain ex- wife Nicole Brown and her friend Ronald Goldman sealed and said he might consider sealing the crime-scene photos. That means only the jury would see them.</p>
<p>He also ordered hearings to determine if two methods of blood testing are scientifically viable before ruling if they may be used in presenting evidence.</p>
<p>Legal scholars agree it will be impossible to find jurors who know nothing about the case. Simpson's yearlong criminal trial was broadcast throughout on national television.</p>
<p>The media frenzy inspired by the first trial has largely subsided, thanks mostly to Fujisaki's decision to pull the plug on TV coverage.</p>
<p>But given the enormous publicity generated by the criminal case, the best hope, experts say, is to pick jurors who can set aside their opinions and decide the civil suit based on the evidence presented in court.</p>
