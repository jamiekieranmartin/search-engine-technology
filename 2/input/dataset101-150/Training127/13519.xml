<p>China, recently voted one of the most dangerous countries in which to fly, is putting the brakes on its surging civil aviation industry to focus on safety.</p>
<p>Shen Yuankang, vice minister of the General Administration of Civil Aviation of China, said the nation's airlines needed to expand to meet demand, but that safety concerns had to limit the pace of growth.</p>
<p>&quot;We cannot allow airlines to develop blindly,&quot; Shen said.</p>
<p>For China's aviation industry, 1992 through 1994 were years of living dangerously.</p>
<p>&quot;There were nine crashes in 1992 and 1993... The speed of development was too fast... The safety situation in 1992 and 1993 was very, very bad,&quot; he said in a recent interview.</p>
<p>The International Airline Passengers Association cited China in 1994 as one of the most dangerous places in the world to fly after five crashes and 10 hijackings to Taiwan in 1993. A string of accidents over four months in 1992 killed 276 people.</p>
<p>In June 1994, 160 people were killed in China's worst reported air mishap when a Soviet-built Tupolev crashed on a domestic flight from Xian, home to the famed Qin dynasty (221-206 BC) terracotta warriors.</p>
<p>&quot;We cannot let...(aviation) development exceed what is realistically possible,&quot; Shen said. &quot;Development and safety should be balanced.&quot;</p>
<p>China's civil aviation sector has expanded rapidly in the past 15 years, growing by an annual average of 20.6 percent between 1980 and 1995. It was forecast to grow by an average of 14 percent annually over the next five years.</p>
<p>The nation's airlines will put in service about 240 new planes through the end of 2000. Though some 80 planes will be retired during that period, the airlines' capacity will still be stretched.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a question of trained pilots,&quot; he said. &quot;We need to have enough people who are properly trained.&quot;</p>
<p>About 2,400 new pilots have been trained in the past four years, but that is still not enough.</p>
<p>New safety rules were put in place last year that ban airlines from taking delivery of new planes for three years after a crash.</p>
<p>Regulators also will not approve an airline's application to buy new planes if the average number of hours its planes are used daily is below the national average, and if less than half the seats are sold.</p>
<p>The number of flying hours of each pilot cannot exceed 100 a month or 1,000 a year.</p>
<p>China has seen some results from its safety efforts. Its airlines have gone 25 consecutive months without a crash.</p>
<p>Shen said most of the new planes added to the domestic fleet would be 150- to 200-seaters, although there would be a growing market for 100-seaters after 2000 due to low operating costs.</p>
<p>The official declined to give the cost of the planes or say how many would be built by U.S. or European companies.</p>
<p>China had 416 planes at the end of 1995, more than 40 percent of which were U.S.-made.</p>
<p>The passenger volume and amount of cargo handled by airlines were expected to double current levels to 100 million passengers and 2.36 million tonnes by 2000, the official said.</p>
<p>Only six of China's 29 airlines were profitable, Shen said. He declined to give figures.</p>
