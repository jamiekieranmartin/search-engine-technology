# Default Variables

qf = 1
k1 = 1.2
k2 = 100
b = 0.75
R = 0 
r = 0 

# Note

- R and r are equal to zero as there is no relevance information

- As k2 = 100 and qf = 1, the third section of the formula can be calculated as such: (100+1)*1 / (100+1) = 101 / 101 = 1

# gi

gi is the query feature function. Here we utilise and calculate:

    - ni, the frequency of the query term in all documents

    - N, the total number of documents

# fi
