<p>Sherritt International Corp said on Tuesday that its wholly-owned metallurgical technologies business plans to acquire all outstanding shares of Dynatec International Ltd, a private mining and drilling services company, and spin off the merged company.</p>
<p>The new company to be formed by the merger of Sherritt International Consultants Inc and Dynatec will be called Dynatec Corp.</p>
<p>Sherritt said it is filing with Canadian securities regulators a preliminary prospectus for a divided-in-kind to its shareholders of all of its interest in Dynatec, after which it will no longer hold any Dynatec securities.</p>
<p>Dynatec Corp will be a publicly traded Canadian company, with Dynatec Intl's management retaining a significant equity interest in the company.</p>
<p>W. Robert Dengler will be president and chief executive officer of Dynatec, Sherritt said.</p>
<p>Sherritt's Cuba interests have caused it problems because of U.S. trade laws that penalize such activities.</p>
