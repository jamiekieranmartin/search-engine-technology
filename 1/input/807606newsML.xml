<p>Trilon Financial Corp said on Tuesday it will tender its 57-percent stake in London Insurance Group to Great-West Lifeco Inc's C$2.9 billion bid for the insurer if Royal Bank of Canada does not match the Great-West offer.</p>
<p>&quot;We're in a position to wait and see what the Royal Bank will do... if they fail to match (the Great-West bid) we would (tender our stake to the Great-West bid),&quot; Trilon spokesman George Myhall said in a telephone interview.</p>
<p>Royal Bank has three days to respond to the competing bid for London Insurance.  </p>
<p>Canada's largest bank in June bid C$2.4 billion for London Insurance.</p>
<p>&quot;We're clearly happy for all of our shareholders... that a better offer has emerged,&quot; Myhall added.</p>
<p>Great-West's C$33.50 per share bid, which represents a 21 percent premium over Royal Bank's C$27.50 per share bid, surprised the Canadian stock market Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Royal Bank deal was thought to have been sewn up after Trilon, London Insurance's majority shareholder, agreed to tender its stake to that offer in June.</p>
